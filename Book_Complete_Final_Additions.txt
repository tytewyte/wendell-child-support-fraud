INTRODUCTION

Who This Book Is For

If you're reading this, you're probably in a fight you didn't choose.

Maybe you received a child support order that doesn't match reality. Maybe the state claims you owe tens of thousands in arrears, but the numbers don't add up. Maybe you've been called a "deadbeat dad" even though you've been paying, or trying to pay, or never owed what they claim in the first place.

Maybe you've been told the system is fair, that the records are accurate, that you just need to accept what they say you owe.

And maybe, like me, you've started to question whether any of that is true.

This book is for you.

It's for fathers who've been crushed by a child support system that prioritizes revenue over accuracy. It's for parents who've been lied to by caseworkers, dismissed by hearing officers, and bankrupted by fraudulent arrears.

It's for anyone who's ever felt powerless against a system designed to intimidate, confuse, and extract money—whether you owe it or not.

But most importantly, this book is for warriors. For people who refuse to accept fraud. For people who are willing to document, research, and fight back.

If that's you, keep reading.

What This Book Will Teach You

This isn't a legal textbook. I'm not a lawyer. I'm a father who discovered fraud in my child support case and decided to fight back.

What I learned along the way—through persistence, documentation, and partnership with AI—is what I'm sharing with you in this book.

You'll learn:

• How to spot fraud in child support records (contradictory audits, impossible dates, fabricated amounts)
• How to document evidence in a way that courts can't ignore
• How to use AI as a legal research partner (without needing a law degree)
• How to draft motions, affidavits, and supporting documents
• How to prepare for hearings and handle opposition
• How to stay persistent when the system tries to break you
• How to turn your fight into a mission that helps others

This book is part memoir, part manual, part manifesto. It's my story—but it's also your roadmap.

My Mission

I didn't write this book to make money. I wrote it because I know what it feels like to be crushed by a system that doesn't care about truth.

For twelve years, I lived under a fraudulent judgment. For twelve years, I was labeled a "deadbeat dad" based on lies. For twelve years, I believed the system was too big, too powerful, too rigged for me to fight.

Then my partner Jess uncovered the fraud. Five contradictory audits. Two contradictory affidavits. Dismissed arrears re-claimed. A caseworker's admission that they had no records for five years.

And I realized: the system isn't invincible. It's vulnerable. Because it's built on lies.

Lies collapse when you document them. Fraud fails when you expose it. The system breaks when you refuse to give up.

My mission is simple: to help you do what I'm doing. To give you the tools, the templates, the strategies, and the encouragement you need to fight back.

Because you're not alone. There are hundreds—maybe thousands—of fathers fighting the same battle. And when we fight together, when we share knowledge and support each other, we don't just win individual cases.

We change the system.

A Note About AI

Throughout this book, I talk about using artificial intelligence as a legal research partner. Some people are skeptical. "Can AI really help with legal work?"

The answer is yes—but with limits.

AI can:
• Explain legal concepts in plain English
• Summarize statutes and case law
• Help you organize evidence and spot contradictions
• Draft motion templates and affidavit outlines
• Simulate opposition so you can practice your arguments

AI cannot:
• Replace a good lawyer (if you can afford one)
• Appear in court for you
• Guarantee you'll win
• Make legal decisions for you

Think of AI as a tireless research assistant who's available 24/7, doesn't charge by the hour, and can process information faster than any human. It's not magic. It's a tool. But it's a powerful one.

I used AI to draft my 114-paragraph affidavit, organize my evidence into comparison charts, and research Louisiana statutes. Without AI, I would have spent months—maybe years—trying to do what I accomplished in weeks.

If you're fighting without a lawyer, AI levels the playing field. And I'm going to show you exactly how to use it.

---

A Warning

This book is not legal advice. I'm not a lawyer, and I can't give you legal advice. What I can give you is my experience, my strategy, and my tools.

Every case is different. Every state has different laws. What worked for me might not work exactly the same way for you.

But the principles are universal:
• Document everything
• Expose contradictions
• Stay persistent
• Demand accountability

If you can afford a lawyer, hire one. A good lawyer is worth every penny.

But if you can't afford a lawyer—or if lawyers won't take your case—don't give up. You can fight for yourself. This book will show you how.

---

Let's Begin

Twelve years ago, a fraudulent judgment was entered against me. I accepted it because I didn't know how to fight back.

Today, I'm fighting back. And I'm going to win.

Not because I'm smarter than the system. Not because I have more resources. But because I have the truth, documented in their own words, and I refuse to give up.

You have that same power. You just need to learn how to use it.

Let's begin.

===================================================================

CHAPTER 2 - ENHANCED VERSION (WITH HEARING SCENE)

Chapter 2: The System is Broken — Fraudulent Affidavit

This is what $32,000 in child support arrears looks like on paper:

A messy, handwritten affidavit with numbers scribbled in boxes. "$200." "$400." "Total." "$19,000." "$32,000." No explanation. No receipts. No proof.

Just Charlotte's signature at the bottom, swearing it's all true.

Seven years earlier, she had sworn under oath that I owed $5,600. Now it was $32,000. Six times more. No explanation for how $5,600 became $32,000 when the case was closed for five of those years.

The hearing officer looked at this affidavit—this messy, contradictory, unverified piece of paper—and adjudicated $32,674 against me. No questions asked. No proof required. Just Charlotte's word.

That's all it took to create a debt that would haunt me for over a decade.

---

Charlotte's Changing Story

When Charlotte was married to Mr. Neely, child support was "a waste of her time." That's what she said. Those were her words.

Mr. Neely had plenty of money. She didn't need my $400 a month. So we went to the courthouse, and she agreed to dismiss $10,150 in arrears. Just wipe it away. Done.

She consented. She signed off on it. She said it was a waste of her time to deal with child support. Fine. I was relieved. $10,150 gone. Fresh start.

Then she divorced Mr. Neely.

Suddenly, child support wasn't a waste of time anymore. Suddenly, she needed that money. So she went back to DCFS in December 2012 and reapplied. And in March 2013, she swore under oath that I owed $32,000.

That $32,000 included the $10,150 she had voluntarily dismissed. The same arrears she said were "a waste of her time" when she had Mr. Neely's money.

She changed her mind. And she thought she could just re-claim dismissed arrears because her circumstances changed. But that's not how the law works. You can't dismiss arrears when you don't need the money, then re-claim them when you do.

That's fraud. That's perjury. That's res judicata.

---

The May 14, 2013 Hearing

I walked into the Rapides Parish Courthouse on May 14, 2013, carrying a folder with the dismissal document inside.

The document clearly stated at the top: "$10,150 DISMISSED." The amount was circled. It was official. It was proof that a substantial portion of the arrears Charlotte was claiming had already been legally dismissed.

I thought I was appearing before a judge. The hearing was in a courtroom. The hearing officer wore robes. She sat at the bench. Everyone called her "Your Honor."

How was I supposed to know she wasn't a real judge?

No one told me. No one said, "Mr. Avant, this is a hearing officer, not a judge. You have the right to request a hearing before an actual judge. You have six days to make that request."

Nothing.

I sat down. Charlotte was there with her attorney. The hearing officer called the case.

I tried to explain. I said, "I have documentation that Ten Thousand One Hundred Fifty Dollars in arrears was dismissed. I brought the document with me."

I held up the folder. I tried to show it to the hearing officer.

She didn't look at it.

She said, "You're not getting away with not paying."

I tried again. "But this document shows—"

She cut me off. "You're a deadbeat dad. You owe this money."

I felt the words hit me like a punch. Deadbeat dad. In front of everyone. In front of Charlotte. In front of the attorney. In a courtroom where I thought I was supposed to get a fair hearing.

The hearing officer had already decided. She didn't want to see my evidence. She didn't want to hear my explanation. She had made up her mind before I even walked in.

I looked at the dismissal document in my hand. I looked at the hearing officer's face—hostile, dismissive, closed.

And I realized: this isn't a fair hearing. This is a rubber stamp.

I stood up. I said, "I can see the court is for Charlotte."

And I walked out.

I felt defeated. Humiliated. Hopeless.

I didn't know I had six days to appeal. I didn't know I could request a hearing before a real judge. I didn't know I had any rights at all.

Six days later, on May 20, 2013, a judge I never appeared before signed the order. $32,674. Based on hearsay. Including dismissed arrears. Adjudicated by a hearing officer, not a judge. With a six-day appeal window I never knew existed.

The order said: "No motion for Judge hearing has been timely requested."

Of course not. I didn't know I could request one.

And just like that, the fraudulent judgment became final.

That's how they got me.

Plain Language Legal Note

• **Fraud upon the court:** When someone lies or fabricates evidence in a way that undermines the integrity of the judicial process.

• **Res judicata:** Latin for "a matter already judged." Once a debt is dismissed, it cannot be re-litigated. Think of it like a canceled check—you can't cash it again.

• **Hearing officer vs. Judge:** A hearing officer is not a judge. They're a state employee with limited authority. You have the right to request a hearing before an actual judge, but they often don't tell you that.

• **Appeal deadline:** In Louisiana, you have six days to request a hearing before a judge after a hearing officer's decision. If you miss that deadline, the decision becomes final.

---

Takeaway Box — What You Can Learn From My Story

• Affidavits must be backed by receipts or records. Challenge affidavits that rely only on one person's word.
• If arrears were dismissed, they cannot be re-claimed (res judicata). Document every dismissal order and keep certified copies.
• Know the difference between a hearing officer and a judge. You have the right to request a judge.
• Know your appeal deadlines. In Louisiana, it's six days. Don't let them hide that from you.
• If a hearing officer shows bias, document it. Their behavior can be grounds for appeal.

Reflection Prompt

Have you ever seen an affidavit or claim in your case that didn't match the records? Have you ever been before a hearing officer without knowing you could request a judge? How would you prove the contradiction or bias if challenged in court?

===================================================================

CHAPTERS 6-7 ENHANCED (WITH SPECIFIC EXAMPLES)

Chapter 6: Their Weapons

The system doesn't fight fair. It uses intimidation, bias, and procedural tricks.

Here are the weapons they'll use against you—and how I know, because they used them all against me.

---

Contradictory Audits

They overwhelm you with paperwork, hoping you'll accept one version and forget about the others.

**In my case:** DCFS sent me five different audits, all claiming to be the "official" record of my child support history.

• Audit #1: Start date 1992, total arrears $30,000
• Audit #2: Start date 1995, total arrears $28,000
• Audit #3: Start date 2005, total arrears $32,000
• Audit #4: Start date 2006, total arrears $30,231
• Audit #5: Start date 2006, total arrears $30,231.90

Five different versions. All supposedly pulled from the same database. None of them matching.

This wasn't an accident. It was designed to confuse me. If I questioned one audit, they'd send another. If I questioned that one, they'd send a third. The goal was to make me give up trying to figure out which one was "real."

But here's the truth: if they can't agree on the numbers, none of them are reliable.

**How to counter this weapon:** Save every version. Don't throw away the "wrong" audits. Keep all of them. They're evidence of fraud. Create a comparison chart showing the contradictions side by side. Force them to explain which one is correct.

---

Hearsay Affidavits

They rely on one person's word instead of records. In child support cases, the rules of evidence are often ignored. Hearsay that would never be allowed in a criminal trial is accepted without question.

**In my case:** Charlotte's messy, handwritten affidavit had no receipts, no records, no bank statements, no proof. Just her word that I owed $32,000.

Seven years earlier, she had sworn under oath that I owed $5,600. Now it was $32,000. No explanation for the 471% increase. No documentation to support it.

But the hearing officer accepted it anyway. Because in child support court, the custodial parent's word is often treated as gospel.

**How to counter this weapon:** Challenge affidavits that lack supporting documentation. If the same person has filed multiple affidavits with different amounts, highlight the contradictions. Cite your state's perjury statute (in Louisiana, it's La. R.S. 14:123). Ask the court: "If both affidavits are sworn under oath, and they contradict each other, which one is perjury?"

---

Bias in Hearings

Hearing officers call you names, dismiss your evidence, and side with the petitioner before you even present your case.

**In my case:** Hearing Officer M.F. Rauls called me a "deadbeat dad" in open court. She refused to look at my dismissal document. She said, "You're not getting away with not paying," before I had even finished explaining.

The outcome was decided before I walked in. The hearing was just a formality.

This isn't unique to my case. Bias is built into the system. Hearing officers are state employees. They work for the same agency (DCFS) that's trying to collect the arrears. They have an incentive to maximize collections, not to ensure accuracy.

**How to counter this weapon:** Document the bias. Take notes during the hearing. Write down exactly what was said. If the hearing officer refuses to look at evidence, state it on the record: "Your Honor, I'm presenting Exhibit A, the dismissal document. For the record, the hearing officer has refused to review it." If they call you names, document it in your affidavit. Bias is grounds for appeal.

---

Procedural Traps

Deadlines are hidden, rules are unclear, appeals are buried in fine print.

**In my case:** I had six days to request a hearing before a real judge after the hearing officer's decision. Six days.

No one told me. The deadline wasn't explained in the courtroom. It wasn't printed in bold letters on the order. It was buried in Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure, which I had never read.

By the time I learned about the six-day deadline, it was too late. The hearing officer's decision became final.

This is how the system traps you. Not by beating you in a fair fight, but by hiding the rules and hoping you don't figure them out in time.

**How to counter this weapon:** Learn the deadlines and procedures in your state. Don't rely on the court to tell you. Research your state's child support enforcement statutes. Ask AI: "What are the appeal deadlines for child support hearings in [your state]?" File everything early. Don't wait until the last day. And if you miss a deadline because you weren't informed, argue that you were denied due process.

---

Their Weapon is Confusion

If you don't know the rules, they win by default.

If you don't save contradictory audits, they can claim the most recent one is correct.

If you don't challenge hearsay affidavits, they become "evidence."

If you don't document bias, it's your word against theirs.

If you don't know the deadlines, you lose your right to appeal.

Confusion is their most powerful weapon. And the antidote is knowledge, documentation, and persistence.

---

Takeaway Box

• Expect intimidation and bias. It's built into the system.
• Don't assume audits are accurate. Save every version and compare them.
• Challenge affidavits that lack proof. Highlight contradictions between sworn statements.
• Learn deadlines and procedures. Don't rely on the court to inform you.
• Document everything—bias, refused evidence, procedural violations. It's your ammunition for appeal.

Reflection Prompt

What "weapons" has the system used against you? Contradictory records? Hearsay affidavits? Bias? Hidden deadlines? How can you prepare to counter them?

===================================================================

Chapter 7: Your Weapons

You are not defenseless. Your weapons are documentation, persistence, and clarity.

Every audit saved, every affidavit highlighted, every contradiction noted becomes ammunition. Your binder is your shield. Your persistence is your sword.

And now, you have a new weapon: AI. A partner that can help you research, analyze, and prepare. AI can't stand in court for you, but it can sharpen your arguments, organize your evidence, and simulate opposition so you're ready.

Let me show you exactly what weapons I used—and how you can use them too.

---

Documentation

Documentation is your strongest weapon. Without it, you're arguing from memory. With it, you're presenting proof.

**In my case, my documentation included:**

• **Five contradictory audits:** Each one labeled, dated, and organized. I created a comparison chart showing the contradictions side by side.

• **Two contradictory affidavits from Charlotte:** Her 2006 affidavit claiming $5,600 and her 2013 affidavit claiming $32,000. Both sworn under oath. Both attached as exhibits.

• **April Tate's admission:** Her November 20, 2025 email stating "CSE did not enforce the child support order from January 2008 through April 2013." Printed, highlighted, and filed.

• **Timeline of events:** A chronological list of every significant date—court orders, dismissals, case closures, reapplications, hearings. This timeline showed the fraud visually.

• **Dismissal document:** The official document showing $10,150 dismissed. (I lost the original over eleven years, but I documented that I had it at the May 14, 2013 hearing and requested the court obtain it from the Clerk's records.)

Every piece of documentation turned suspicion into proof. It transformed "I think they're lying" into "Here's the evidence that they're lying."

**How to use this weapon:** Save everything. Print emails. Label audits. Organize affidavits. Create comparison charts. Build a binder with tabs for each category. Make it impossible for the court to ignore.

---

Persistence

Persistence wins battles others give up on.

The system is designed to wear you down. They send you five different audits hoping you'll get confused and give up. They call you a "deadbeat dad" hoping you'll feel ashamed and stop fighting. They hide deadlines hoping you'll miss them and lose your right to appeal.

But persistence breaks the system. Because fraud can't stand up to someone who refuses to quit.

**In my case:** I didn't give up when the hearing officer called me a deadbeat dad. I didn't give up when I walked out of that courtroom feeling defeated. I didn't give up when I discovered I had missed the six-day appeal deadline.

I kept researching. I kept documenting. I kept asking questions. And twelve years later, I'm still fighting.

That persistence led to Jess uncovering the five audits. It led to April Tate's admission. It led to this book.

**How to use this weapon:** Don't give up. When they deny your motion, file another one. When they ignore your evidence, present it again. When they try to intimidate you, stay calm and stay focused. Persistence is the difference between victims and warriors.

---

Clarity

Clarity persuades judges more than emotion.

Most people lose in family court because they argue from emotion. "This isn't fair." "I'm a good parent." "I've been paying." "I don't owe this much."

Those are subjective claims. The court can dismiss them with a shrug.

But clarity—objective, documented, undeniable clarity—is different.

**In my case, I didn't argue:**
"This isn't fair."

**I argued:**
"Charlotte Neely swore under oath in 2006 that I owed $5,600. In 2013, she swore under oath that I owed $32,000. Both affidavits are attached as Exhibits A and B. One of these sworn statements is false. This is perjury under Louisiana Revised Statute 14:123."

**I didn't argue:**
"The audits are wrong."

**I argued:**
"The State has sent me five different audits, all claiming to be the official record of my child support history. Audit #1 shows a start date of 1992. Audit #2 shows a start date of 1995. Audit #3 shows a start date of 2005. All five audits are attached as Exhibits C-G. I respectfully ask the Court: Which audit is correct?"

**I didn't argue:**
"I don't think I owe this much."

**I argued:**
"April Tate, the CSE Manager, admitted in writing that 'CSE did not enforce the child support order from January 2008 through April 2013.' However, the audits show records for those exact years. These two positions are mutually exclusive. Either April Tate is correct and there are no records (in which case the audits are fabricated), or the audits are correct (in which case April Tate's statement is false). The State cannot have it both ways."

Clarity forces the court to confront the contradictions. It makes fraud undeniable.

**How to use this weapon:** Don't argue feelings. Argue facts. Don't say "I think." Say "Here's the evidence." Use specific dates, amounts, and exhibits. Cite statutes. Ask questions the court can't answer without admitting fraud.

---

AI

AI is your newest weapon. And it's a game-changer.

**In my case, AI helped me:**

• **Research Louisiana statutes:** I asked AI to explain Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Article 2004 (grounds to vacate a judgment based on fraud). It summarized the law in plain English and showed me how to apply it to my case.

• **Draft my 114-paragraph affidavit:** I told AI what happened at the May 14, 2013 hearing. It organized my story into professional legal format with numbered paragraphs, proper structure, and citations.

• **Create comparison charts:** I gave AI the five audits and asked it to highlight the contradictions. It created a side-by-side chart that made the fraud visual.

• **Prepare for opposition:** I asked AI to role-play as the opposing attorney. It simulated their arguments so I could practice my responses.

• **Organize my evidence:** AI helped me create a timeline, label exhibits, and structure my motion.

Without AI, I would have spent months—maybe years—trying to do what I accomplished in weeks.

**How to use this weapon:** Treat AI like a research partner. Ask it to explain legal terms. Ask it to draft motion templates. Ask it to compare documents for contradictions. Ask it to simulate opposition. But always review what it generates. Always verify against official sources. Always make it your own.

AI doesn't replace your voice. It amplifies it.

---

Your Arsenal

When you combine documentation, persistence, clarity, and AI, you become dangerous to the system.

You're not just another "deadbeat dad" they can dismiss. You're a warrior with proof, with strategy, with tools, and with the determination to win.

That's how you beat the machine.

---

Takeaway Box

• Documentation is your strongest weapon. Save everything. Organize everything. Present everything.
• Persistence wins battles others give up on. Don't quit. Ever.
• Clarity persuades judges more than emotion. Argue facts, not feelings.
• AI can help you prepare, but you must fight in person. Use it to research, draft, and organize—but make it your own.

Reflection Prompt

What weapons do you already have? What can you add—documentation, persistence, clarity, or AI—to strengthen your fight?

3. Issue subpoenas for [OBLIGEE NAME], [CASEWORKER NAME], [CSE MANAGER NAME], and [HEARING OFFICER NAME] to testify;

4. Order production of all DCFS records related to this case;

5. Refer the matter to the District Attorney for investigation of perjury under La. R.S. 14:123;

6. Award Mover such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
