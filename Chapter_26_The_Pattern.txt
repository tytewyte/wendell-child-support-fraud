Fighting Back: My Story of Fraud, Truth, and Victory

PART 7: THE BIGGER PICTURE

Chapter 26: THE PATTERN
Why This Fight Is Bigger Than Child Support

You thought this book was about child support fraud. It is. But it's also about something much bigger. Once you understand the pattern I'm about to show you, you'll see it everywhere. And you'll never be fooled again.

THE MOMENT I SAW IT

It happened late one night. I was researching, digging deeper into how systems operate, when I stumbled across something that made me stop cold.

The child support system wasn't unique.

The fraud, the inversion, the gatekeeping, the wealth extraction—it was all following a pattern. The same pattern used by institutions throughout history. The same pattern used by systems that claim to help you but actually control you.

Once I saw the pattern, I couldn't unsee it.

And now I'm going to show it to you.

---

THE FIVE-STEP MIMIC PATTERN

Every control system—whether it's religious, legal, medical, educational, or financial—follows the same playbook:

**STEP 1: Take Something Real**

Start with something genuine. Something sacred. Something people need or trust.

• A sacred site with real spiritual energy
• A justice system meant to protect children
• A healing practice meant to cure disease
• An education system meant to empower minds

The foundation has to be real. Otherwise, people won't trust it.

**STEP 2: Invert Its Purpose**

Take that real thing and flip it. Make it serve the opposite purpose.

• Turn a spiritual gateway into a control tower
• Turn child support into a revenue machine
• Turn healing into dependency on pills
• Turn education into debt slavery

The inversion is subtle. It still *looks* like the original. But it *functions* in reverse.

**STEP 3: Install Hierarchy and Gatekeeping**

Make sure people can't access the real thing directly. They have to go through YOU.

• "You need a priest to reach God."
• "You need the State to enforce child support."
• "You need a doctor to prescribe medicine."
• "You need a degree to prove you're educated."

Direct access is removed. Intermediaries are installed. Gatekeepers extract fees.

**STEP 4: Extract Wealth and Energy**

Now that you control access, you can extract resources.

• Tithes, donations, gold vaults
• Federal Title IV-D funding, inflated arrears
• Insurance payments, pharmaceutical profits
• Student loan debt, tuition inflation

The system doesn't exist to serve you. It exists to extract from you.

**STEP 5: Suppress the Truth**

Hide the evidence. Bury the texts. Silence the whistleblowers.

• Hide the Gnostic gospels that teach direct knowing
• Ignore dismissal documents and send contradictory audits
• Suppress natural cures and alternative treatments
• Gatekeep knowledge behind paywalls and credentials

If people knew the truth, the system would collapse. So the truth must be suppressed.

That's the pattern. Five steps. Every time.

And once you see it, you see it everywhere.

EXAMPLE 1: THE VATICAN — A MIMIC NODE IN PLAIN SIGHT

Let me show you how this pattern plays out in one of the most powerful institutions in history: The Vatican.

**STEP 1: Take Something Real**

Ancient Rome was a high-frequency spiritual convergence point. Underneath what is now the Vatican sits:
• A convergence of ley lines (energy pathways)
• A memory field holding ancient wisdom codes
• A node of recursion—a place where awareness could return to itself (gnosis)

This was a real sacred site. A place of spiritual power. A mirror gate where people could access divine knowing directly.

**STEP 2: Invert Its Purpose**

The Vatican didn't activate this node. It walled it off, inverted it, and redirected the energy to fuel a centralized control grid.

It took a feminine recursion node (inner knowing, direct connection to source) and installed a masculine control tower on top (hierarchy, obedience, external authority).

True recursion says: "The divine is within. The temple is your body."

Vatican mimic says: "You need an intermediary. You are fallen. Come confess. Come pay. Come obey."

**STEP 3: Install Hierarchy and Gatekeeping**

The Vatican positions itself between you and God.

It replaces the circle (direct connection) with a triangle:

God → Church → You

Instead of:

You ↔ Mirror ↔ All

You can't reach God directly. You need:
• A priest to hear your confession
• A pope to interpret scripture
• Sacraments administered by the Church
• Salvation granted through institutional approval

The keys to heaven? They're not given to you. They're held by the gatekeepers.

**STEP 4: Extract Wealth and Energy**

Underneath the Vatican:
• Catacombs, ossuaries, crypts
• Tunnels of dead memory and trauma codes
• Vaults of hoarded light (hidden texts, suppressed artifacts, ancient frequencies)

Above:
• Gold, opulence, throne rooms
• Men in robes pretending to channel light while sitting on a graveyard of suppressed signal
• Immense wealth accumulated over centuries

The institution preaches poverty while hoarding gold. It sits on bones and treasure. That's not how true spiritual recursion works. That's mimic feeding on distortion.

**STEP 5: Suppress the Truth**

The Vatican hid the Gnostic gospels—texts that taught direct knowing:

• Gospel of Thomas: "The kingdom of God is within you."
• Gospel of Mary: Mary Magdalene as spiritual teacher and equal.
• Gospel of Philip: The divine feminine as essential to wholeness.

These texts were excluded from the canon. Why? Because they taught people they didn't need the Church. They could access divinity directly.

The Vatican also:
• Removed the Magdalene (the mirror flame, the feminine balance)
• Created a disempowered version of Jesus—whitewashed, severed from gnosis
• Turned the Christ Mirror into a Mimic Idol

And notice the symbols:

• The pine cone (third eye, inner knowing) → Displayed as a giant statue, but not taught as inner awakening
• The keys (access codes) → Used to lock gates, not open them
• The dome (womb geometry, creation) → Turned into a masculine throne cap
• The obelisk (divine masculine) → Placed at the center but severed from its sacred context, used as a power symbol

These symbols are real. But they're reversed.

Just like mimic always does:
• Looks familiar
• Sounds true
• But feeds on control, not liberation

EXAMPLE 2: THE CHILD SUPPORT SYSTEM — THE SAME PATTERN

Now let's look at my case. The child support system. Different domain. Same pattern.

**STEP 1: Take Something Real**

Child support is a real need. Children deserve financial support from both parents. That's legitimate. That's the foundation.

**STEP 2: Invert Its Purpose**

But the system doesn't exist to help children. It exists to generate revenue.

Under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, states receive federal funding based on how much child support they collect. The more they collect, the more federal money they get.

So the incentive isn't accuracy. It's volume.

The system is inverted:
• Real purpose: Support children
• Actual function: Maximize arrears to maximize federal funding

**STEP 3: Install Hierarchy and Gatekeeping**

You can't resolve child support directly with the other parent. You have to go through the State.

• DCFS becomes the payee
• Caseworkers control the records
• Hearing officers adjudicate the debt
• You have no direct access to the truth

Even when Charlotte said child support was "a waste of her time" and closed the case, the State kept it open. Why? Because they control access. They are the gatekeepers.

**STEP 4: Extract Wealth and Energy**

The State fabricates arrears to maximize extraction:

• Five contradictory audits, all with different numbers
• A 1992 start date (impossible—my child wasn't born until 1997)
• Charlotte's affidavit jumping from $5,600 to $32,000 with no explanation
• Dismissed arrears ($10,150) re-claimed years later

They're not trying to find the truth. They're trying to find the highest number they can justify. Because every dollar collected brings in federal matching funds.

**STEP 5: Suppress the Truth**

When I presented the dismissal document at the May 14, 2013 hearing, the hearing officer refused to look at it.

When Jess requested records, they sent five different audits—hoping we'd accept one and forget the others.

When April Tate admitted in writing that "CSE did not enforce the child support order from January 2008 through April 2013," that admission contradicted the audits showing enforcement during those years.

The truth is suppressed. The evidence is ignored. The fraud is protected.

EXAMPLE 3: THE MEDICAL SYSTEM — BRIEF GLIMPSE

**STEP 1: Take Something Real**
Healing. Medicine. The body's ability to recover.

**STEP 2: Invert Its Purpose**
Turn healing into dependency. Treat symptoms, not root causes. Create lifelong patients, not cured individuals.

**STEP 3: Install Gatekeeping**
You can't heal yourself. You need a doctor. You need a prescription. You need insurance approval.

**STEP 4: Extract Wealth**
Pharmaceutical profits. Insurance premiums. Hospital bills that bankrupt families.

**STEP 5: Suppress the Truth**
Natural remedies are dismissed as "unproven." Alternative treatments are marginalized. Cures that don't generate profit are buried.

Same pattern. Different domain.

---

EXAMPLE 4: THE EDUCATION SYSTEM — BRIEF GLIMPSE

**STEP 1: Take Something Real**
Learning. Knowledge. The expansion of human potential.

**STEP 2: Invert Its Purpose**
Turn education into indoctrination. Teach compliance, not critical thinking. Create workers, not free thinkers.

**STEP 3: Install Gatekeeping**
You can't prove you're educated without a degree. You can't get a degree without going through the institution.

**STEP 4: Extract Wealth**
Student loan debt. Tuition inflation. A generation enslaved to debt before they even start working.

**STEP 5: Suppress the Truth**
Real history is rewritten. Critical texts are excluded. Alternative education models are dismissed.

Same pattern. Different domain.

---

THE AWAKENING

Once you see the pattern, you can't unsee it.

You start recognizing it everywhere:

• Banking systems that claim to protect your money but actually extract wealth through fees, interest, and inflation
• News media that claims to inform you but actually controls the narrative
• Social media that claims to connect you but actually harvests your data and manipulates your behavior
• Government agencies that claim to serve you but actually regulate and control you

The pattern is everywhere.

And here's the key insight:

**These aren't separate conspiracies. They're all using the same playbook.**

Take something real.
Invert its purpose.
Install gatekeeping.
Extract wealth.
Suppress the truth.

Five steps. Every time.

WHY THIS MATTERS FOR YOUR FIGHT

When you're fighting the child support system, you're not just fighting a broken bureaucracy. You're fighting a mimic node.

And mimic nodes operate on the same principles everywhere.

That means:

**1. The tactics that work against one mimic node work against others.**

Documentation. Evidence. Forcing contradictions into the light. Citing the law. Refusing to accept lies.

These tactics worked for me in child support. They work against the Vatican. They work against any system that operates on inversion and suppression.

**2. You're not alone.**

Millions of people are fighting mimic nodes in their own domains:
• Fathers fighting child support fraud
• Patients fighting medical tyranny
• Students fighting education debt
• Citizens fighting government overreach

We're all fighting the same pattern. And when we recognize that, we can share strategies, support each other, and build a movement.

**3. Your victory matters beyond your case.**

When you expose fraud in the child support system, you're not just winning your case. You're exposing the pattern. You're showing others how mimic nodes operate. You're teaching people to see.

And once people see, they become dangerous to the system.

---

HOW TO FIGHT THE PATTERN

Now that you see the pattern, here's how to fight it:

**1. Recognize the Inversion**

Ask yourself: "What is this system supposed to do? What is it actually doing?"

If the answer is different, you've found the inversion.

**2. Document the Contradictions**

Mimic nodes can't keep their story straight. They send five different audits. They make contradictory statements. They hide evidence.

Document every contradiction. Organize it. Present it clearly.

**3. Force Transparency**

Mimic nodes thrive in darkness. They suppress truth. They hide records. They rely on you not asking questions.

Force them into the light. Request records. Cite statutes. Demand explanations.

**4. Refuse Gatekeeping**

Don't accept that you need their permission to access the truth.

You don't need a priest to reach God. You don't need a caseworker to know what you owe. You don't need a doctor to heal. You don't need a degree to learn.

Reclaim direct access.

**5. Share What You Learn**

The system wants you isolated. It wants you to think you're the only one fighting.

Share your story. Share your evidence. Share your strategies.

When we connect, we become unstoppable.

THE BIGGER MISSION

This book started as my story of fighting child support fraud.

But it's become something bigger.

It's a manual for recognizing and fighting mimic nodes in any domain.

Because the pattern is the same. The tactics are the same. The victory is the same.

When you expose fraud, you're not just winning your case. You're waking people up. You're teaching them to see the pattern. You're empowering them to fight back.

That's the real victory.

Not just my freedom from fraudulent debt.

But a movement of people who see the pattern, refuse to accept it, and fight back with truth.

---

YOU THOUGHT THIS WAS JUST ABOUT CHILD SUPPORT

You came to this book looking for help with child support fraud.

And you got that. Chapters 1-25 give you everything you need to fight your case.

But now you have something more.

You have the pattern.

You have the ability to see how control systems operate—not just in child support, but everywhere.

You have the tools to recognize inversion, document contradictions, and force truth into the light.

You have the knowledge that you're not fighting alone. You're part of a larger awakening.

And you have the power to become a warrior in your own domain.

---

THE PATTERN IS BREAKING

Here's the good news:

The mimic nodes are losing power.

Why?

Because people are waking up.

The Vatican's attendance is declining. People are leaving organized religion and seeking direct spiritual connection.

The medical system's credibility is crumbling. People are questioning pharmaceutical solutions and exploring natural healing.

The education system's monopoly is breaking. People are learning online, for free, without debt.

The child support system's fraud is being exposed. Fathers are documenting contradictions, filing motions, and winning.

The pattern is breaking because people are seeing it.

And once you see it, you can't be controlled by it anymore.

---
