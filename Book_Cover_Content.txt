[BOOK DESCRIPTION - Top 2/3 of back cover]

THEY SAID I OWED $32,000 IN CHILD SUPPORT ARREARS.

But the numbers didn't add up.

Five different audits. Five different amounts. All claiming to be "official."

Two sworn affidavits from my ex—one saying $5,600, another saying $32,000. Both under oath. One had to be perjury.

Dismissed arrears that mysteriously reappeared after her divorce.

A hearing officer who called me a "deadbeat dad" and refused to look at my evidence.

A system designed to extract money, not deliver justice.

For twelve years, I accepted it. I believed the system. I paid what they said I owed.

Then my partner Jess uncovered the fraud. And everything changed.

---

This is the story of how we fought back.

Not with a lawyer. Not with thousands of dollars. But with persistence, documentation, and an unlikely ally: artificial intelligence.

AI became my research partner, helping me understand the law, draft legal documents, and organize evidence. Together with Jess—who discovered the contradictions and built the case—we transformed from victims into warriors.

This book is part memoir, part manual, part manifesto.

It's my story—but it's also your roadmap.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

CHARLES WENDELL AVANT JR. is a father, warrior, and advocate for child support reform. After discovering that his $32,000 child support judgment was based on fraudulent evidence—including five contradictory audits and two contradictory sworn affidavits—he decided to fight back.

Without a law degree or legal representation, Wendell partnered with his partner Jess (who uncovered the fraud) and artificial intelligence (which helped him research law and draft documents) to build an airtight case exposing systemic fraud in Louisiana's child support enforcement system.

His mission is simple: help other fathers fight back against fraudulent arrears, expose corruption in child support enforcement, and show the world how AI can empower ordinary people to stand up against systems designed to crush them.

Wendell lives in Louisiana with his partner Jess. This is his first book, but it won't be his last.
