CHAPTER 26
THE NATIONAL MOVEMENT FOR FAMILY COURT REFORM

You are not alone.

If you've read this far, you know my story. You know about the fraud, the lies, the contradictions, the stolen money, the biased hearing officer, and the system that tried to break me.

But here's what you might not know: my story is not unique.

Thousands of fathers across this country face the same abuses every single day. False allegations. Financial manipulation. Lack of transparency. Judicial bias. Violations of parental rights. The weaponization of children against their own parents.

For decades, good parents have been crushed by a family court system that has lost its way. A system that was designed to protect children has been twisted into a weapon used to destroy families.

But something is changing.

A movement is rising. A movement of parents who refuse to be silenced. A movement of advocates who refuse to accept the status quo. A movement that is transforming pain into purpose and demanding systemic change.

This chapter is about that movement. It's about the man who started it. It's about the laws that are changing. And it's about how you can join the fight.

THE MAN WHO CHANGED TEXAS

His name is Robert Garza.

Like me, Robert is a father. Like me, he was falsely accused during a custody battle. Like me, he lost precious time with his children during an investigation that found no abuse or neglect. Like me, he was told by attorneys that it was pointless to fight.

But unlike many fathers who give up, Robert refused to accept defeat.

When the investigation cleared him and he got his children back, Robert asked a simple question: "Can I get back the time I lost with my kids?"

The answer was no.

Even though he was falsely accused. Even though the investigation found nothing. Even though he was completely innocent. The time he lost with his children was gone forever, and the court had no mechanism to restore it.

That injustice burned in Robert's heart. He could have walked away bitter and defeated. He could have accepted that the system was broken and moved on with his life.

Instead, he decided to change the system.

Robert Garza sat down and drafted a bill. A bill that would require Texas courts to order additional parenting time to compensate for time lost during false investigations. A bill that would restore justice to falsely accused parents. A bill that would say, loud and clear: if you accuse someone falsely, there will be consequences, and the innocent parent will be made whole.

He called it "Time Taken, Time Back."

And on September 1, 2023, Texas Senate Bill 718 became law.

Robert Garza, a regular father with no political connections and no law degree, changed the law in the second-largest state in America.

If he can do it, so can we.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TEXAS SB-718: "TIME TAKEN, TIME BACK"

Let me explain what this law does, because it's revolutionary.

Before SB-718, if you were falsely accused of child abuse or neglect, the Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) would investigate. During that investigation—which could take weeks or months—you would lose time with your children. Supervised visits only, or no visits at all.

Then, when the investigation concluded and found no abuse or neglect, you would get your regular custody schedule back.

But the time you lost? Gone forever.

No make-up time. No compensation. No acknowledgment that you were innocent and your accuser was wrong. The system just moved on, and you were left with a hole in your relationship with your children that could never be filled.

Texas SB-718 changed that.

Now, under Texas law, if a DFPS investigation does not result in a finding of abuse or neglect, the court must order additional periods of possession or access to compensate the parent for the time they lost.

Read that again: the court MUST order additional time.

Not "may." Not "at the court's discretion." MUST.

Unless a party can show "good cause" why the order should not be rendered, the falsely accused parent gets their time back.

This is justice.

This law does three critical things:

First, it restores the parent-child relationship. Time lost during false investigations damages the bond between parent and child. This law helps repair that damage by giving parents additional time to rebuild that bond.

Second, it deters false allegations. If you know that falsely accusing someone will result in them getting extra time with the children, you're less likely to make false accusations. False allegations are no longer a winning strategy.

Third, it sends a message: the system will not tolerate the weaponization of children. Parents who make false allegations to gain an advantage in custody battles will not be rewarded. Instead, the innocent parent will be made whole.

Texas SB-718 is a model for the nation. Every state should pass this law.

And Robert Garza didn't stop there.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE NINE BILLS FOR FAMILY COURT REFORM

After the success of SB-718, Robert Garza got to work on something even bigger: a comprehensive package of nine bills designed to address every major abuse in the family court system.

These nine bills are fully written and ready for any state legislature to file. They address the exact problems that have harmed parents and children for decades.

Let me break them down for you:

BILL 1: FALSE ALLEGATIONS ACCOUNTABILITY ACT
This bill creates penalties for parents who make false allegations of abuse or neglect during custody proceedings. If an investigation finds no evidence of abuse, and the court determines the allegation was made in bad faith, the accusing parent faces consequences including loss of custody time, financial penalties, and potential criminal charges for perjury.

Why this matters: False allegations are the nuclear weapon of custody battles. They destroy reputations, damage parent-child relationships, and waste court resources. This bill makes false accusers think twice.

How it applies to my case: Charlotte made false allegations. She claimed I was a "deadbeat dad" who refused to pay. The evidence shows I paid consistently and she lied. Under this bill, she would face consequences.

BILL 2: PARENTAL ALIENATION PREVENTION ACT
This bill recognizes parental alienation as a form of child abuse and gives courts the authority to intervene when one parent systematically turns a child against the other parent. Courts can order therapy, modify custody, and impose sanctions on alienating parents.

Why this matters: Parental alienation destroys children. When one parent poisons a child's mind against the other parent, the child loses a relationship that is critical to their development. This bill protects children from psychological abuse.

How it applies to my case: My children don't talk to me anymore. Charlotte has spent years telling them I'm a deadbeat, that I don't care about them, that I abandoned them. None of it is true, but the damage is done. Under this bill, the court could intervene and order therapy to repair our relationship.

BILL 3: TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN CHILD SUPPORT ACT
This bill requires child support agencies to maintain accurate, consistent records and provide parents with clear documentation of all payments, arrears calculations, and account adjustments. Agencies that provide contradictory information face audits and potential sanctions.

Why this matters: My case proves why this is needed. Five contradictory audits. An admission that no records exist for five years. Mathematical impossibilities. This is fraud, and it's happening nationwide. This bill stops it.

How it applies to my case: Under this bill, DCFS would be required to provide me with accurate, verified records. The five contradictory audits would trigger an immediate audit. The admission of no records would result in sanctions. The fraud would be exposed and corrected.

BILL 4: ANTI-GATEKEEPING ACT
This bill prevents one parent from unilaterally blocking the other parent's access to the children in violation of court orders. Parents who engage in gatekeeping face swift enforcement, including makeup time, fines, and potential loss of custody.

Why this matters: Court orders mean nothing if they're not enforced. Too many parents ignore custody orders and face no consequences. This bill ensures that court orders are respected and enforced.

How it applies to my case: When Charlotte decided child support was "a waste of her time," she essentially gatekept my relationship with the children by creating a hostile environment. Under this bill, her interference would have consequences.

BILL 5: FINANCIAL ABUSE PREVENTION ACT
This bill prohibits the manipulation of child support calculations through false income reporting, hidden assets, or fraudulent claims of arrears. Parents who engage in financial abuse face penalties including repayment of improperly collected funds, fines, and potential criminal charges.

Why this matters: Child support is supposed to support children, not enrich one parent at the expense of the other. Financial abuse—claiming arrears that don't exist, hiding income, manipulating calculations—is rampant. This bill stops it.

How it applies to my case: DCFS and Charlotte claimed I owed $32,000 in arrears. The evidence shows this is false. Under this bill, they would be required to prove the arrears with accurate documentation. When they couldn't, I would be entitled to repayment of the $25,000+ they stole from me.

BILL 6: JUDICIAL EFFICIENCY ACT
This bill requires family courts to resolve cases in a timely manner and prevents unnecessary delays that harm children and families. Courts must set firm deadlines for hearings, discovery, and final orders. Judges who allow cases to drag on for years face oversight and potential sanctions.

Why this matters: Justice delayed is justice denied. My case has been ongoing since 2013. Twelve years of fighting. Twelve years of stress. Twelve years of my life consumed by this battle. This bill ensures that cases are resolved quickly so families can move forward.

How it applies to my case: Under this bill, my case would have been resolved years ago. The hearing officer's refusal to review my evidence would have been overturned on appeal. The contradictory audits would have triggered an immediate investigation. Justice would have been served.

BILL 7: DUE PROCESS PROTECTION ACT
This bill ensures that parents in family court proceedings receive full due process protections, including the right to present evidence, the right to confront witnesses, the right to an impartial decision-maker, and the right to appeal. Hearing officers must inform parties of their right to request a judge.

Why this matters: The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees due process. But in family court, due process is often ignored. Parents are railroaded through hearings with biased decision-makers who refuse to consider evidence. This bill restores constitutional protections.

How it applies to my case: At the May 14, 2013 hearing, I was denied due process. The hearing officer called me a "deadbeat dad," refused to review my evidence, and denied me the opportunity to present my case. I was never informed of my right to request a judge. Under this bill, that hearing would be void, and I would get a new hearing before an impartial judge.

BILL 8: CHILD-FIRST PRIORITY ACT
This bill requires courts to prioritize the best interests of the child above all other considerations, including the financial interests of parents or the convenience of the court. Courts must consider the child's relationship with both parents and cannot use children as pawns in adult disputes.

Why this matters: Family court should be about protecting children, not punishing parents. Too often, courts make decisions based on money, convenience, or bias rather than what's actually best for the child. This bill refocuses the system on children.

How it applies to my case: If the court had prioritized my children's best interests, they would have investigated Charlotte's lies, ensured I had a relationship with my kids, and stopped the financial abuse. Instead, the system treated my children as a revenue source and me as a cash machine.

BILL 9: ACCOUNTABILITY AND ENFORCEMENT ACT
This bill holds judges, hearing officers, child support agencies, and parties accountable for violations of family court rules and procedures. Judges who show bias face discipline. Agencies that provide false information face sanctions. Parents who lie under oath face perjury charges.

Why this matters: Without accountability, there is no justice. Right now, judges, hearing officers, and agencies can violate the rules with impunity. This bill ensures that everyone in the system is held to the same standard.

How it applies to my case: Under this bill, the hearing officer who called me a "deadbeat dad" and refused to review my evidence would face discipline. DCFS, which provided five contradictory audits and admitted to having no records, would face sanctions. Charlotte, who filed two contradictory sworn affidavits, would face perjury charges.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

MY CASE PROVES THE NEED FOR THESE BILLS

Look at my story through the lens of these nine bills, and you'll see why they're desperately needed:

• False allegations: Charlotte lied about me being a "deadbeat dad." (Bill 1)
• Parental alienation: My children don't talk to me anymore. (Bill 2)
• Lack of transparency: Five contradictory audits, no records for five years. (Bill 3)
• Gatekeeping: Charlotte blocked my relationship with the children. (Bill 4)
• Financial abuse: Over $25,000 stolen through fraud. (Bill 5)
• Judicial delays: Fighting since 2013, twelve years and counting. (Bill 6)
• Due process violations: Biased hearing officer, evidence refused. (Bill 7)
• Child not prioritized: System treated my children as revenue source. (Bill 8)
• No accountability: No consequences for lies, fraud, or bias. (Bill 9)

Every single one of these bills addresses an abuse I experienced.

My case is not unique. Thousands of fathers face these same abuses every day.

These nine bills will stop the abuse.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE MOVEMENT IS SPREADING

Texas passed SB-718 in 2023. That was just the beginning.

Robert Garza and the National Family Justice organization are now working with legislators, advocates, and parents in states across the country to introduce these nine bills.

The movement is growing. The momentum is building. The system is starting to change.

But we need more voices. We need more stories. We need more warriors willing to stand up and say: "Enough. The abuse stops here."

That's where you come in.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

HOW YOU CAN JOIN THE FIGHT

If you've read this book, you know the system is broken. You've seen the evidence. You've heard my story. Maybe you have a similar story of your own.

Now it's time to act.

Here's how you can join the national movement for family court reform:

1. CONTACT YOUR STATE LEGISLATORS

Find your state senator and state representative. Call them. Email them. Schedule a meeting. Tell them your story. Show them the evidence of abuse in your case. Ask them to introduce Robert Garza's nine bills in your state.

Don't know what to say? Here's a template:

"Dear [Legislator],

My name is [Your Name], and I am a constituent in your district. I am writing to ask you to support family court reform legislation.

For [X] years, I have been fighting a family court case that has been marked by [false allegations / financial abuse / lack of transparency / judicial bias / etc.]. The system that is supposed to protect children and families has instead caused tremendous harm to me and my children.

I recently learned about nine bills for family court reform that have been drafted by Robert Garza and the National Family Justice organization. These bills address the exact abuses I have experienced, including [list specific bills that apply to your case].

Texas has already passed one of these bills (SB-718, 'Time Taken, Time Back'), and other states are preparing to follow. I am asking you to introduce these bills in [Your State] so that other families don't have to suffer the way mine has.

I would be happy to meet with you to discuss this further and provide documentation of the abuses I have experienced.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your Contact Information]"

2. CONNECT WITH NATIONAL FAMILY JUSTICE

Robert Garza is the Vice President of National Family Justice (NFJ), an organization dedicated to family court reform. NFJ provides resources, support, and advocacy for parents fighting unjust family court decisions.

Website: https://nationalfamilyjustice.org/
Robert Garza's website: https://robertgarza.us/

Reach out. Join the organization. Attend events. Connect with other parents who are fighting the same battle. You are not alone.

3. SHARE YOUR STORY

The system thrives in darkness. The abuses continue because they're hidden. Judges, hearing officers, and agencies get away with misconduct because no one is watching.

Shine a light.

Share your story on social media. Write about your experience. Document the abuses you've faced. Use hashtags like:

#FamilyCourtReform
#TimeTakenTimeBack
#JusticeForParents
#EndParentalAlienation
#ParentalRights
#AccountabilityNow
#FixTheSystem
#TruthMatters

The more people who speak up, the harder it becomes for the system to ignore us.

4. SUPPORT LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS

When these bills are introduced in your state, show up. Attend legislative hearings. Testify if you can. Bring other parents with you. Show the legislators that this is not just one person's complaint—this is a systemic problem affecting thousands of families.

Your presence matters. Your voice matters. Your story matters.

5. HELP OTHER PARENTS

If you've made it through your case (or you're still fighting), help other parents who are just starting their journey. Share what you've learned. Provide emotional support. Connect them with resources.

That's why I wrote this book. That's why I'm building VelocityLeads.com. That's why I'm creating an AI agent to help fathers navigate the system.

We rise by lifting others.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THIS IS A MOVEMENT FOR THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE

Robert Garza said it best:

"This movement is not about politics. It is about restoring fairness and accountability to a system that has been weaponized against good families for far too long."

This is not a Republican issue or a Democrat issue. This is not a conservative issue or a liberal issue. This is a human issue. A family issue. A justice issue.

Parents on both sides of the political aisle are suffering. Children on both sides of the political aisle are being harmed. The system is broken for everyone.

The nine bills are common-sense reforms that protect children, support families, and restore integrity to the family court system. They should have bipartisan support in every state.

"When these nine bills spread across the country, the games, manipulation, and abuse in family court will come to an end."

This is the goal. This is the mission. This is what we're fighting for.

"This is a movement for the people, by the people, and it cannot be stopped."

He's right. The movement cannot be stopped.

Because we will not stop.

We will not be silenced. We will not be intimidated. We will not give up.

We will keep fighting until every state has passed these reforms. We will keep fighting until every child is protected. We will keep fighting until every parent receives justice.

We will keep fighting until the system is fixed.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

MY COMMITMENT TO YOU

I am joining this movement. I am bringing these nine bills to Louisiana. I am using my case as proof of why these reforms are needed.

And I'm asking you to join me.

Together, we can win our individual cases and change the system.

Together, we can provide individual justice and systemic reform.

Together, we can help ourselves and help thousands of others.

This is how my voice will be heard. Not just in a courtroom in Rapides Parish, Louisiana. But in the Louisiana State Capitol. And in state capitols across the country.

This is how your voice will be heard too.

Join the movement. Contact your legislators. Share your story. Support the reforms.

Let's change the system together.

Because the abuse stops here.

And the healing begins now.
