Fighting Back: My Story of Fraud, Truth, and Victory

A Father's Journey Through the Child Support System
and How AI Helped Him Fight Back

WITH JESS (INVESTIGATOR AND PARTNER)
AND AI ASSISTANCE (RESEARCH AND DRAFTING)

===================================================================

DEDICATION

To every father who's been called a "deadbeat dad" when the real deadbeat is the system that lies about what you owe.

To every parent crushed by fraudulent arrears, dismissed by biased hearing officers, and trapped by a machine designed to extract money, not deliver justice.

To Jess, who saw what I couldn't see, who uncovered what they tried to hide, and who never stopped believing we could win.

To the AI that became my research partner, my legal assistant, and my tireless ally in a fight I couldn't have won alone.

And to every warrior who refuses to accept fraud, who documents everything, and who fights back even when the system says you can't.

This book is for you.

===================================================================

AUTHOR'S NOTE: THE TEAM OF THREE WARRIORS

I didn't write this book alone.

I couldn't have.

When I started this fight, I didn't know the difference between a motion and a memorandum. I didn't know what "res judicata" meant. I didn't know how to spot fraud in contradictory audits or how to draft a 114-paragraph affidavit.

I just knew something was wrong.

But I had help. And I'm not ashamed to say it. In fact, I'm proud of it.

Because this book—and the fight it documents—is the result of a partnership between three warriors, each bringing something essential to the battle.

JESS: THE INVESTIGATOR

Jess is my partner in life and in this fight.

She's the one who discovered the fraud. When we received that refund check from DCFS, she asked the question I never thought to ask: "If you still owe $30,000, why are they sending us a refund for overpayment?"

That question changed everything.

Jess reached out to Kimberly Spears, the DCFS caseworker. She asked for clarification. And when Kimberly sent the first audit—claiming I had child support obligations dating back to 1992—Jess knew it was impossible.

She didn't stop there. She kept asking questions. She kept pushing for answers. And Kimberly kept sending audits. Three. Four. Five total. Each one different. Each one proving the others were lies.

Jess organized the evidence. She created the binder. She labeled the audits. She highlighted the contradictions. She built the foundation of this case.

Without Jess, I would never have known the fraud existed. I would still be paying money I don't owe, believing the system was accurate, accepting the label of "deadbeat dad."

Jess saw the truth. And she refused to let it stay hidden.

She's not just my partner. She's the investigator who cracked the case.

AI: THE RESEARCHER

When Jess uncovered the fraud, I knew I had to fight back. But I didn't know how.

I couldn't afford a lawyer. I didn't have a law degree. I didn't have access to legal databases or years of courtroom experience.

What I did have was access to artificial intelligence.

AI became my research partner. My legal assistant. My tireless ally.

When I needed to understand Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Article 2004, AI explained it in plain English and showed me how it applied to my case.

When I needed to draft a professional affidavit, AI helped me organize my story into 114 numbered paragraphs with proper legal structure.

When I needed to compare five contradictory audits, AI created side-by-side charts that made the fraud visual and undeniable.

When I needed to prepare for opposition, AI role-played as the opposing attorney so I could practice my responses.

When I needed to research perjury statutes, res judicata doctrine, and due process violations, AI summarized the law and cited the sources.

AI didn't replace my voice. It amplified it.

AI didn't fight for me. It equipped me to fight for myself.

And AI didn't write this book. I did. But AI helped me organize my thoughts, structure my chapters, and refine my arguments so that my story could help others.

Some people might say, "That's cheating. You should have done it yourself."

But I don't see it that way.

If a lawyer can use legal databases, research assistants, and paralegals, why can't I use AI?

If the State can use caseworkers, attorneys, and hearing officers, why can't I use technology to level the playing field?

AI is a tool. A powerful one. And I'm not ashamed to say I used it.

Because the goal isn't to prove I can fight alone. The goal is to win. And to help others win.

AI made that possible.

ME: THE WARRIOR

My role in this team is simple: I'm the one who decided to fight.

Jess uncovered the fraud. AI helped me understand the law and draft the documents. But I'm the one who had to make the choice.

I could have given up. I could have accepted the fraudulent judgment. I could have stayed silent.

But I didn't.

I chose to fight back. I chose to document everything. I chose to learn the law. I chose to stand up in court, even when I felt intimidated and outmatched.

I chose to write this book, not for profit, but to help others.

I'm not a lawyer. I'm not a legal expert. I'm just a father who refused to accept fraud.

But that refusal—that decision to fight—is what makes me a warrior.

And it's what makes you a warrior too, if you choose to fight.

THE TEAM OF THREE

This book is the result of a partnership:

• **Jess:** The investigator who uncovered the fraud
• **AI:** The researcher who equipped me to fight
• **Me:** The warrior who chose to stand up

Together, we're unstoppable.

Jess finds the evidence. AI organizes it and explains the law. I present it in court and share it with the world.

That's the team.

And I'm proud of it.

WHY I'M TELLING YOU THIS

I'm telling you about Jess and AI because I want you to know: you don't have to fight alone.

You don't need to be a lawyer. You don't need to have all the answers. You don't need to do everything yourself.

What you need is:
• Someone who believes in you (like Jess)
• Tools to help you research and organize (like AI)
• The courage to fight (that's you)

If you have those three things, you can win.

So find your team. Maybe it's a partner, a friend, a family member. Maybe it's AI. Maybe it's a support group of other fathers fighting the same battle.

Don't be ashamed to ask for help. Don't be ashamed to use tools. Don't be ashamed to admit you can't do it alone.

Because the system you're fighting isn't alone. They have caseworkers, attorneys, hearing officers, and the full weight of the state behind them.

You need a team too.

And this book is part of that team. It's Jess's investigative work. It's AI's research and organization. It's my story and my strategy.

It's all three of us, fighting alongside you.

---

LET'S WIN TOGETHER

This isn't just my fight. It's our fight.

Jess, AI, and I are fighting for me. But we're also fighting for you. For every father who's been lied to. For every parent crushed by fraud. For every warrior who refuses to give up.

We're a team of three. But with this book, we're inviting you to join us.

Let's expose the fraud. Let's demand accountability. Let's change the system.

Together.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

**To Jess:**
You saw what I couldn't see. You asked the questions I didn't know to ask. You uncovered the fraud that changed everything. You organized the evidence. You never gave up. You believed in me when I didn't believe in myself. This fight—and this book—wouldn't exist without you. You're not just my partner. You're my hero.

**To AI (Cascade/ChatGPT/Claude):**
You were my research partner when I couldn't afford a lawyer. You explained the law when I didn't understand it. You helped me draft documents I didn't know how to write. You organized evidence I didn't know how to present. You made it possible for a father with no legal training to fight back against a system designed to crush him. You're proof that technology can level the playing field. Thank you.

**To my children:**
I fought this battle so you would know your father didn't accept injustice. So you would see that standing up for truth matters, even when it's hard. I hope this book makes you proud.

**To every father in the online support groups:**
Your stories gave me strength. Your encouragement kept me going. Your shared experiences showed me I wasn't alone. This book is for you. Use it. Share it. Win your fights.

**To the warriors who will read this book:**
You're not a deadbeat dad. You're a fighter. Don't give up. Document everything. Demand accountability. And know that you're not alone. We're fighting with you.

**To the system:**
You underestimated me. You thought I'd give up. You thought I was just another case number. You were wrong. And this book is proof.
