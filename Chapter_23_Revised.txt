Fighting Back: My Story of Fraud, Truth, and Victory

PART 6: VICTORY AND BEYOND

Chapter 23: What Victory Will Look Like

As I write this, I'm still in the fight. The Motion to Vacate Judgment hasn't been filed yet. The hearing hasn't happened. The fraudulent arrears haven't been officially vacated.

But I know what victory will look like. Because I've already won in the ways that matter most.

---

The Evidence is Undeniable

I have five contradictory audits from DCFS. Each one claims to be the "official" record. Each one tells a different story. Each one proves the others are lies.

I have two sworn affidavits from Charlotte. In 2006, she swore under oath that I owed $5,600. In 2013, she swore under oath that I owed $32,000. One of those statements is perjury. Both can't be true.

I have April Tate's admission, in writing, that "CSE did not enforce the child support order from January 2008 through April 2013." Yet the audits show records for those exact years. They can't both be true.

I have documentation that $10,150 in arrears was dismissed with Charlotte's consent. She said child support was "a waste of her time" when she was married to Mr. Neely. Then she divorced him and re-claimed the same arrears she had voluntarily dismissed. That violates res judicata.

The evidence is undeniable. The fraud is documented. The contradictions are impossible to explain away.

That's the first victory: I have proof.

I'm No Longer the Same Person

Twelve years ago, when that fraudulent judgment was entered, I accepted it. I believed the system. I thought, "Who am I to question the State?"

I'm not that person anymore.

I've learned legal research. I've drafted a 114-paragraph affidavit. I've created comparison charts. I've organized evidence into a binder that would make a lawyer proud.

I've partnered with AI to sharpen my arguments, structure my motion, and prepare for every objection they'll throw at me.

I've transformed from a victim into a warrior.

Charlotte thinks I'm still the same person I was twenty years ago. The State thinks I'm just another "deadbeat dad" who'll give up. They're wrong.

That's the second victory: I've become someone they didn't expect.

What Legal Victory Will Look Like

When I file my Motion to Vacate Judgment, here's what I expect to happen:

**Best Case Scenario:**
The judge reviews the evidence—the five contradictory audits, the two contradictory affidavits, April's admission, the dismissed arrears—and realizes the judgment was obtained by fraud. The judgment is vacated. The fraudulent arrears are erased. I'm vindicated.

**Likely Scenario:**
The State fights back. They deny the fraud. They claim the most recent audit is correct (ignoring the four others). They argue Charlotte's 2013 affidavit supersedes her 2006 affidavit (ignoring that one is perjury). They try to bury the contradictions under procedural objections.

But I'm prepared. I have the evidence organized. I have the law cited. I have the contradictions highlighted. I stay focused on facts, not emotion. I force them to explain the unexplainable.

The judge may not rule immediately. There may be continuances, additional hearings, appeals. But eventually, the truth wins. Because fraud can't stand when it's documented.

**Worst Case Scenario:**
The judge rules against me anyway. The system protects itself. Bias wins over evidence.

But even then, I don't lose. Because I have a documented record of the fraud. I have grounds for appeal. I have evidence for federal complaints (FBI, HHS, Attorney General). I have a story to tell that will help hundreds of other fathers.

The fight doesn't end with one hearing. It ends when the fraud is exposed and the system is forced to change.

What Personal Victory Looks Like

Legal victory is important. But personal victory is bigger.

Personal victory is knowing I didn't give up. It's knowing I fought back when the system expected me to stay silent. It's knowing I documented the fraud, learned the law, and stood up for myself.

Personal victory is reclaiming my dignity. For twelve years, I've been labeled a "deadbeat dad." That label is a lie. And I'm going to prove it.

Personal victory is showing my children that their father didn't accept injustice. That he fought for the truth. That he stood up even when it was hard.

Personal victory is partnering with Jess, who believed in me when I didn't believe in myself. Who uncovered the fraud. Who organized the evidence. Who stood by me through every step of this fight.

Personal victory is using this experience to help others. Writing this book. Building a website. Sharing templates. Creating a community of warriors who refuse to accept fraud.

That's victory. Not just winning in court. But becoming the person who fights back.

What Victory Will Mean for Others

When I win—and I will win, whether in this court or the next, whether through this motion or an appeal—it won't just be my victory.

It will prove that fraud can be exposed. That contradictions can't be ignored. That the system can be beaten when you document everything and refuse to give up.

It will give hope to the hundreds of fathers in online support groups who feel helpless. Who've been told they owe money they don't actually owe. Who've been crushed by a system designed to extract revenue, not deliver justice.

It will provide a roadmap. A template. A proof of concept.

If I can do it—without a lawyer, without money, just with persistence, documentation, and AI—then anyone can.

That's the bigger victory. Not just my case. But the movement it starts.

Why I'm Confident

I'm confident because I have what most people don't: documented proof of fraud.

Most people lose in family court because they argue emotion. "This isn't fair." "I'm a good parent." "I don't owe this much."

Those are subjective claims. The system eats them for breakfast.

But I'm not arguing emotion. I'm presenting objective proof:

- Five audits, all different, all claiming to be official
- Two affidavits, both sworn under oath, contradicting each other by $26,400
- April's admission that CSE didn't enforce for five years, contradicted by audits showing enforcement for those years
- Dismissed arrears re-claimed in violation of res judicata

These aren't opinions. These are facts. And facts win.

I'm confident because I've prepared. I've documented everything. I've organized my evidence. I've learned the law. I've practiced my arguments.

I'm confident because I have Jess. I have AI. I have a mission bigger than myself.

And I'm confident because I know the truth. And the truth, when documented and presented clearly, is unstoppable.

What I'll Do When I Win

When the judgment is vacated, when the fraudulent arrears are erased, when I'm vindicated—here's what I'll do:

**1. Update this chapter.** I'll change the title from "What Victory Will Look Like" to "My Victory." I'll add the details of the hearing, the judge's ruling, the outcome. I'll make it real.

**2. Publish this book.** I'll share it with every father who's fighting the same battle. I'll make it available for free or low cost. Because this isn't about profit—it's about helping others.

**3. Build the website.** Velocityleads.com will become a resource hub. Templates, guides, comparison charts, community support. Everything I wish I had when I started this fight.

**4. File complaints.** FBI, Attorney General, HHS, Legislative Auditor. I'll report the fraud to every agency with jurisdiction. I'll demand accountability.

**5. Help others win.** I'll share my motion, my affidavit, my strategy. I'll coach others through their fights. I'll build an army of warriors who refuse to accept fraud.

**6. Demand reform.** I'll push for legislative changes. Transparency in child support enforcement. Accountability for caseworkers who fabricate records. Consequences for perjury. Real reform.

That's what victory will enable. Not just my freedom from fraudulent debt. But a movement to change the system.

**NOTE TO READERS:**

This chapter was written before my case was resolved. By the time you read this, the outcome may already be known. If the judgment has been vacated, you'll find an updated version of this chapter in the appendix titled "My Victory."

But even if you're reading this before the outcome is decided, remember: victory isn't just about the ruling. It's about the fight. It's about refusing to accept fraud. It's about documenting the truth and demanding accountability.

That victory is already won.

The rest is just paperwork.
