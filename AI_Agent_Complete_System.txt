WHAT THE AI AGENT CAN DO
===================================================================

PHASE 1: CASE INTAKE & ANALYSIS
─────────────────────────────────

The AI interviews the user and analyzes their situation:

QUESTIONS AI ASKS:
• What state are you in?
• What's your situation? (fraud, modification, contempt, arrears)
• Do you have contradictory documents?
• What evidence do you have?
• What's your goal? (vacate judgment, reduce arrears, prove fraud)

AI ANALYZES:
• Spots potential fraud indicators
• Identifies legal claims available
• Determines what documents are needed
• Creates case strategy

EXAMPLE:
USER: "I'm in Louisiana. I got five different audits showing different amounts."

AI: "This is strong evidence of fraud! In Louisiana, you can file a Motion to Vacate Judgment under La. C.C.P. Article 2004. Let me analyze your audits and create a comparison chart. Upload your five audits and I'll show you the contradictions."

─────────────────────────────────

PHASE 2: EVIDENCE ANALYSIS
─────────────────────────────────

AI analyzes uploaded documents:

WHAT AI DOES:
• Compares multiple audits
• Identifies contradictions
• Calculates mathematical impossibilities
• Creates comparison charts
• Highlights fraud indicators
• Generates evidence summary

EXAMPLE:
USER uploads 5 audits.

AI: "I've analyzed your five audits. Here's what I found:

CONTRADICTIONS:
• Audit 1 (2015): Start date 1992, Total $32,000
• Audit 2 (2020): Start date 2008, Total $28,500
• Audit 3 (2021): Start date 1995, Total $30,200
• Audit 4 (2023): Start date 2008, Total $27,800
• Audit 5 (2025): Start date 2008, Total $32,000

FRAUD INDICATORS:
✓ Five different start dates (impossible)
✓ Five different total amounts (contradictory)
✓ 1992 start date is before child was born (impossible)
✓ Amounts fluctuate without explanation (suspicious)

I've created a comparison chart (download below). This is excellent evidence of fraud. Let's draft your motion."

─────────────────────────────────

PHASE 3: DOCUMENT GENERATION
─────────────────────────────────

AI generates complete, customized legal documents:

DOCUMENTS AI CAN GENERATE:
• Motion to Vacate Judgment (fraud)

• Motion for Contempt Dismissal
• Affidavits (sworn statements)
• Subpoenas (for records)
• Discovery requests
• Comparison charts
• Evidence timelines
• Hearing preparation notes

[AI GENERATES COMPLETE MOTION]

STATE OF LOUISIANA
PARISH OF RAPIDES

CHARLES WENDELL AVANT JR.
vs.
CHARLOTTE BRASKETT AVANT

CASE NO. 218,367

MOTION TO VACATE JUDGMENT

NOW INTO COURT, through undersigned pro se litigant, comes Charles Wendell Avant Jr., who respectfully moves this Honorable Court to vacate the judgment dated [DATE] pursuant to Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Article 2004, on the grounds of fraud upon the court, and in support thereof would show:

I. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

1. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to La. R.S. 46:236.1 et seq.

2. Venue is proper in Rapides Parish as the original judgment was entered in this Court.

II. PARTIES

3. Movant, Charles Wendell Avant Jr., is the obligor in this child support matter.

4. Charlotte Braskett Avant is the obligee.

III. BACKGROUND

5. On [DATE], this Court entered a judgment establishing child support arrears in the amount of $32,000.

6. Movant has recently discovered evidence of fraud upon the court that undermines the validity of this judgment.

IV. NEWLY DISCOVERED EVIDENCE OF FRAUD

7. On November 20, 2025, Movant received five (5) separate child support audit documents from the Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS), all purporting to be official records of his child support account.

8. These five audits contain irreconcilable contradictions that constitute evidence of fraud upon the court.

9. Specifically, the five audits show:
   a. Five different start dates for the child support obligation;
   b. Five different total arrears amounts;
   c. One audit shows a start date of 1992, which is impossible as the child was not born until [DATE];
   d. The amounts vary by thousands of dollars without explanation.

10. A comparison chart of these contradictory audits is attached as Exhibit A.

11. On November 20, 2025, Movant also received an email from April Tate, Manager of Child Support Enforcement, admitting that DCFS has no records of Movant's child support account from 2008 to 2013. This email is attached as Exhibit B.

12. This admission directly contradicts the audits, which purport to show detailed payment records during this exact time period.

13. Additionally, Movant has documentation showing that $10,150 in arrears was dismissed with the consent of the obligee on [DATE]. This dismissed amount was later re-claimed by the obligee after her divorce, without any legal basis. Documentation of this dismissal is attached as Exhibit C.

V. LEGAL BASIS FOR RELIEF

14. Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Article 2004 provides that a final judgment may be annulled if it was obtained by fraud or ill practices.

15. Fraud upon the court occurs when a party or the court itself engages in conduct that undermines the integrity of the judicial process. See Haydel v. Dufresne, 465 So.2d 539 (La. 1985).

16. The presentation of five contradictory official documents, combined with the admission that no records exist for a five-year period, constitutes fraud upon the court.

17. The mathematical impossibility of a 1992 start date (before the child's birth) demonstrates that at least one of these documents is fabricated.

18. The unexplained fluctuation in arrears amounts, ranging from $27,800 to $32,000, indicates systematic manipulation of records.

19. The re-claiming of dismissed arrears without legal authority further demonstrates fraudulent conduct.

20. This newly discovered evidence could not have been discovered through reasonable diligence before the original judgment, as Movant did not receive these contradictory documents until November 20, 2025.

VI. PREJUDICE TO MOVANT

21. Movant has been subjected to enforcement actions based on a fraudulent judgment.

22. Movant's wages have been garnished, tax refunds intercepted, and credit damaged based on arrears amounts that cannot be substantiated.

23. Movant has been denied due process, as the judgment was obtained through fraud.

VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Court:

A. Vacate the judgment dated [DATE] establishing child support arrears;

B. Order DCFS to produce accurate, verified records of Movant's child support account;

C. Order a full audit of Movant's child support account by an independent third party;

D. Enjoin all enforcement actions pending resolution of this matter;

E. Award Movant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

1. Notice of Appeal
2. Appeal Brief
3. Supporting documents

We'll argue that the hearing officer:
• Refused to consider your evidence
• Showed bias
• Failed to address the fraud

Let's start with the Notice of Appeal..."
