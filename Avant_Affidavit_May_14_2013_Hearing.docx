STATE OF LOUISIANA
PARISH OF RAPIDES

BEFORE ME, the undersigned Notary Public, duly commissioned and qualified in and for the Parish of Rapides, State of Louisiana, personally came and appeared:

CHARLES WENDELL AVANT JR.

who, after being first duly sworn by me, did depose and state as follows:

I. IDENTITY AND COMPETENCY

1. My name is Charles Wendell Avant Jr. I am over the age of eighteen (18) years and am competent to make this affidavit.

2. I have personal knowledge of the facts stated herein, and they are true and correct to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief.

3. I am the defendant in Civil Docket Number 218,367 and IV-D Docket Number 010,698, regarding child support for my minor children, Charles W. Avant III (born January 20, 1997) and Abigale McKenzie Avant (born September 21, 2001).

4. This affidavit is submitted in support of my Motion to Vacate Judgment pursuant to Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Article 2004, based on fraud upon the court, lack of jurisdiction, denial of due process, violation of res judicata, and newly discovered evidence.

II. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

5. On July 5, 2005, a Consent Judgment was entered in Civil Docket Number 218,367, ordering me to pay child support in the amount of Four Hundred Dollars ($400.00) per month to Charlotte Braskett Avant (now Charlotte Avant-Neely, hereinafter "Ms. Neely").

6. On or about August 22, 2006, Ms. Neely applied for child support enforcement services with the Louisiana Department of Social Services (DCFS). In her sworn Affidavit of Arrearage dated August 22, 2006, Ms. Neely claimed that I owed Five Thousand Six Hundred Dollars ($5,600.00) in arrears as of that date.

7. On November 5, 2006, pursuant to Louisiana Revised Statute 46:236.2, DCFS became the payee of the child support order, and the case was transferred to the Juvenile Court under IV-D Docket Number 010,698.

8. On or about December 27, 2007, Ms. Neely requested that her child support enforcement case be closed. DCFS closed the case at her request.

9. From January 2008 through April 2013, DCFS did not enforce the child support order. This fact was admitted by April K. Tate, CSE Manager for Alexandria Child Support Enforcement, in her email to me dated November 20, 2025.

10. On or about December 20, 2012, Ms. Neely reapplied for child support enforcement services with DCFS.

11. On March 5, 2013, Ms. Neely executed a new Affidavit of Arrearages, in which she claimed that I owed Thirty-Two Thousand Dollars ($32,000.00) in child support arrears.

12. On May 14, 2013, a hearing was held before Hearing Officer M.F. Rauls regarding the alleged arrears.

13. On May 14, 2013, Hearing Officer M.F. Rauls issued Hearing Officer Findings and Recommendations, adjudicating arrears in the amount of Thirty-Two Thousand Six Hundred Seventy-Four Dollars ($32,674.00) "as of 5/14/13 inclusive of prior judgment(s)."

14. On May 20, 2013, a judge of the Ninth Judicial District Court signed the Hearing Officer's Findings and Recommendations, making them the judgment of the court.

III. THE MAY 14, 2013 HEARING

A. I Believed I Was Appearing Before a Judge

15. On May 14, 2013, I appeared at the Rapides Parish Courthouse for a hearing regarding alleged child support arrears.

16. I received notice of this hearing, but the notice did not adequately inform me of what evidence I needed to bring, what my rights were at the hearing, or the nature of the proceeding.

17. I appeared at the hearing without legal representation. I could not afford to retain an attorney. I was not informed that I had the right to request appointed counsel or a continuance to obtain counsel.

18. The hearing was conducted in a formal courtroom setting. The presiding officer wore judicial robes and sat at the judge's bench.

19. The setting, formality, and appearance of the proceedings led me to reasonably believe that I was appearing before a judge of the Ninth Judicial District Court.

20. At no time before, during, or after the hearing was I informed that the presiding officer was a "hearing officer" rather than a judge.

21. I was never told that I had the right to request a hearing before an actual judge instead of a hearing officer.

22. I was never asked whether I consented to having a hearing officer, rather than a judge, decide my case.

23. I did not knowingly, intelligently, or voluntarily waive my right to appear before a judge.

24. Had I known that I was appearing before a hearing officer and not a judge, and had I known that I could request a hearing before a judge, I would have immediately requested such a hearing.

B. The Voluntary Dismissal of $10,150 in Arrears

25. Prior to the May 14, 2013 hearing, child support arrears in the amount of Ten Thousand One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($10,150.00) had been dismissed by agreement.

26. This dismissal occurred at the Rapides Parish Courthouse, in approximately 2007 or thereafter, but I cannot recall the exact date.

27. The dismissal proceeding took place outside a courtroom—in a hallway, office, or conference room—and did not occur in front of a judge. However, it was an official resolution of the arrears by agreement of the parties.

28. I was present when the Ten Thousand One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($10,150.00) in arrears was dismissed.

29. Ms. Neely was also present and participated in the dismissal. She had to consent to the dismissal, and she did consent.

30. At the time of the dismissal, Ms. Neely stated that child support enforcement was "a waste of her time."

31. Ms. Neely agreed to dismiss the Ten Thousand One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($10,150.00) in arrears because she was married to Mr. Neely at that time, and he had substantial financial resources. Ms. Neely was not in financial need and did not wish to be bothered with child support enforcement proceedings.

32. A caseworker from the Louisiana Department of Social Services (DCFS) was also present at the dismissal and witnessed Ms. Neely's consent to the dismissal. I believe this caseworker may have been Kimberly Spears, but I cannot recall with certainty which DCFS employee was present.

33. As a result of this agreement, I received documentation showing that Ten Thousand One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($10,150.00) in child support arrears had been dismissed.

34. This dismissal document clearly stated at the top: "$10,150 DISMISSED."

35. The amount "$10,150 DISMISSED" was circled on the document for emphasis.

36. The dismissal of the Ten Thousand One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($10,150.00) was a final resolution of those arrears. Under the doctrine of res judicata, Ms. Neely is barred from re-litigating or re-claiming dismissed arrears.

C. I Presented the Dismissal Document at the May 14, 2013 Hearing

37. I brought the dismissal document with me to the May 14, 2013 hearing as evidence that a substantial portion of the arrears being claimed by Ms. Neely had already been legally dismissed.

38. During the hearing, I attempted to present the dismissal document to Hearing Officer M.F. Rauls.

39. I spoke about the dismissal in the courtroom and explained that Ten Thousand One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($10,150.00) in arrears had been dismissed in a prior proceeding.

40. I attempted to show the dismissal document to the hearing officer so that she could see that it clearly stated "$10,150 DISMISSED" at the top, with the amount circled.

D. The Hearing Officer's Hostile Response and Judicial Bias

41. When I attempted to present the dismissal document and explain that Ten Thousand One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($10,150.00) had been dismissed, Hearing Officer M.F. Rauls refused to look at the document.

42. The hearing officer stated to me, in open court and in a hostile tone: "You're not getting away with not paying."

43. The hearing officer then called me a "deadbeat dad" in front of everyone present in the courtroom.

44. I was shocked, embarrassed, and deeply humiliated by being called a "deadbeat dad" by the person who was supposed to be impartially deciding my case.

45. The hearing officer's hostile tone, refusal to consider my evidence, and inflammatory language made it clear to me that she had already decided against me before hearing all the evidence.

46. The hearing officer showed clear bias and prejudice against me and prejudged my case.

47. The hearing officer's conduct created a hostile environment that made it impossible for me to receive a fair hearing.

E. I Left the Hearing

48. After being called a "deadbeat dad" and having my dismissal evidence refused without consideration, I stated to the hearing officer: "I can see the court is for Charlotte."

49. I then left the courtroom.

50. I left because I felt that the hearing officer had already made up her mind against me and would not give me a fair hearing regardless of what evidence I presented.

51. I was embarrassed, angry, humiliated, and felt defeated.

52. The hostile and biased environment created by the hearing officer made it impossible for me to continue participating in the hearing.

53. I did not hear what, if any, testimony Ms. Neely gave after I left the courtroom.

54. I did not hear the hearing officer's final ruling or recommendations.

IV. I WAS NOT INFORMED OF MY APPEAL RIGHTS

55. After I left the hearing on May 14, 2013, I was never informed that I had the right to request a hearing before an actual judge.

56. I was never told that I had only six (6) days—until May 20, 2013—to file a written motion requesting a hearing before a judge.

57. I did not receive any written notice of my appeal rights.

58. I did not receive any written notice of the deadline to request a judge hearing.

59. I did not know that the hearing officer's decision was not final and could be appealed to a judge within six (6) days.

60. I believed that the hearing officer was a judge and that her decision was final and binding.

61. I believed that my only option would be a lengthy and expensive appeals process to a higher court, which I could not afford.

62. Had I been informed that I had six (6) days to request a hearing before a judge, I would have immediately filed such a request.

63. Had I been informed of my appeal rights, I would have appealed based on the hearing officer's bias, her refusal to consider my evidence, and the inclusion of dismissed arrears in the judgment.

64. I do not recall receiving the May 14, 2013 Hearing Officer Findings and Recommendations in a timely manner.

65. If I did receive the order, I did not understand that I had only six (6) days to request a judge hearing or how to exercise that right.

66. The order was not clear to me, as a self-represented litigant, regarding my appeal rights or the procedures for exercising them.

V. THE JUDGMENT VIOLATED RES JUDICATA AND INCLUDED DISMISSED ARREARS

67. Despite my presentation of the dismissal document showing that Ten Thousand One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($10,150.00) had been dismissed, Hearing Officer M.F. Rauls adjudicated arrears in the amount of Thirty-Two Thousand Six Hundred Seventy-Four Dollars ($32,674.00) "as of 5/14/13 inclusive of prior judgment(s)."

68. The language "inclusive of prior judgment(s)" indicates that the hearing officer included all prior arrears in her calculation, including the Ten Thousand One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($10,150.00) that had been dismissed.

69. By including dismissed arrears in the judgment, the hearing officer violated the doctrine of res judicata.

70. I am being forced to pay arrears that were legally dismissed by agreement, which is unjust, illegal, and constitutes fraud upon the court.

VI. MS. NEELY'S KNOWING AND INTENTIONAL FRAUD

71. Ms. Neely's inclusion of dismissed arrears in her March 5, 2013 Affidavit of Arrearages was not a mistake or oversight. It was knowing and intentional fraud.

72. Ms. Neely was personally present when the Ten Thousand One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($10,150.00) in arrears was dismissed.

73. Ms. Neely had to consent to the dismissal, and she did consent.

74. Ms. Neely stated at the time that child support enforcement was "a waste of her time" because she was married to Mr. Neely, who had substantial financial resources.

75. Ms. Neely voluntarily agreed to dismiss the Ten Thousand One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($10,150.00) in arrears because she was not in financial need at that time.

76. The dismissal was a final resolution of those arrears.

77. After Ms. Neely divorced Mr. Neely, she apparently found herself in financial need and reapplied for child support enforcement services in December 2012.

78. Despite having voluntarily consented to the dismissal of Ten Thousand One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($10,150.00), Ms. Neely swore under oath on March 5, 2013, that I owed Thirty-Two Thousand Dollars ($32,000.00) in arrears.

79. Ms. Neely's affidavit claims arrears from 2005 forward, which necessarily includes the period when the Ten Thousand One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($10,150.00) was dismissed.

80. Ms. Neely knowingly and intentionally included dismissed arrears that she had voluntarily agreed to dismiss.

81. Ms. Neely cannot claim that she did not know about the dismissal, because she was present and consented to it.

82. Ms. Neely cannot claim that she forgot about the dismissal, because she personally participated in it and stated that child support was "a waste of her time."

83. Ms. Neely's intentional inclusion of dismissed arrears in her sworn affidavit constitutes perjury under Louisiana Revised Statute 14:123.

84. Ms. Neely's intentional inclusion of dismissed arrears constitutes fraud upon the court.

85. Ms. Neely's attempt to re-claim arrears that she voluntarily dismissed violates the doctrine of res judicata.

86. Ms. Neely cannot change her mind about the dismissal simply because her financial circumstances changed after her divorce from Mr. Neely.

VII. MS. NEELY'S AFFIDAVIT IS CONTRADICTORY AND INSUFFICIENT

87. In her August 22, 2006 Affidavit of Arrearage, Ms. Neely swore under oath that I owed Five Thousand Six Hundred Dollars ($5,600.00) in arrears as of that date.

88. In her March 5, 2013 Affidavit of Arrearages, Ms. Neely swore under oath that I owed Thirty-Two Thousand Dollars ($32,000.00) in arrears.

89. Ms. Neely's arrears claim increased from Five Thousand Six Hundred Dollars ($5,600.00) to Thirty-Two Thousand Dollars ($32,000.00)—an increase of Four Hundred Seventy-One Percent (471%)—over a period of six and one-half (6.5) years.

90. This dramatic increase is unexplained and mathematically impossible, given that:
    a. The child support order was for Four Hundred Dollars ($400.00) per month;
    b. DCFS enforced the order for only fourteen (14) months (November 2006 through December 2007);
    c. The case was closed from January 2008 through April 2013 (over five years); and
    d. Ten Thousand One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($10,150.00) had been dismissed.

91. Ms. Neely's March 5, 2013 affidavit is mathematically incoherent. For the period 2006-2012, she wrote conflicting and unclear numbers: "$200," "$400," "total," "$19,000," and "$32,000." These numbers do not add up and provide no clear month-by-month accounting.

92. Ms. Neely's March 5, 2013 affidavit provides no supporting documentation, such as receipts, bank records, or payment history.

93. Ms. Neely's March 5, 2013 affidavit is pure hearsay—her word alone, with no verification.

VIII. NEWLY DISCOVERED EVIDENCE: DCFS ADMITS IT HAS NO RECORDS

94. In November 2025, I sent a formal written request to the Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) requesting complete documentation of my child support case and payment history.

95. On November 20, 2025, April K. Tate, CSE Manager for Alexandria Child Support Enforcement, responded to my request via email.

96. In her email, Ms. Tate admitted: "CSE did not enforce the child support order from January 2008 through April 2013. Therefore, the only record of payments made during that time is the Affidavit of Arrears completed by Ms. Neely when she reapplied for services on 12/20/2012."

97. This admission proves that the State of Louisiana has no independent records of my child support payments or arrears for the five-year period from January 2008 through April 2013.

98. The State relied solely on Ms. Neely's unverified affidavit—hearsay evidence—to claim that I owed Thirty-Two Thousand Dollars ($32,000.00) in arrears.

99. Over the past several months, my fiancée and I have received five (5) different "official" audits from DCFS, all purporting to show my child support payment history, but all containing different and contradictory information regarding dates, amounts, and arrears owed.

100. The fact that DCFS has sent five (5) different audits, each with different numbers, proves that DCFS does not have accurate records and has fabricated my arrears.

101. One of the audits sent by DCFS caseworker Kimberly Spears contained a date of 1992, which is impossible, as the child support order was not entered until 2005.

102. When my fiancée questioned the 1992 date, Ms. Spears sent a second audit with different numbers.

103. The contradictory audits and DCFS's admission that it has no records for 2008-2013 constitute newly discovered evidence that was not available to me at the time of the May 14, 2013 hearing.

IX. I NO LONGER HAVE THE DISMISSAL DOCUMENT

104. The dismissal document that I presented at the May 14, 2013 hearing was in my possession at that time.

105. It has now been over eleven (11) years since that hearing.

106. I no longer have the physical dismissal document in my possession. It was lost or misplaced over the years.

107. However, I am confident that this dismissal order exists in the official court records maintained by the Rapides Parish Clerk of Court.

108. I respectfully request that the Court obtain this dismissal order from the Clerk of Court's records to verify my testimony.

109. I further request that the Court order DCFS to produce all records regarding the dismissal of Ten Thousand One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($10,150.00) in arrears, including the identity of the DCFS caseworker who was present at the dismissal.

X. CONCLUSION

110. I did not receive a fair hearing on May 14, 2013.

111. I was denied due process because:
     a. I was not informed that I was appearing before a hearing officer rather than a judge;
     b. I did not consent to a hearing officer deciding my case;
     c. The hearing officer showed clear bias and prejudice against me;
     d. The hearing officer refused to consider my evidence;
     e. The hearing officer called me a "deadbeat dad," creating a hostile environment;
     f. I was not informed of my appeal rights;
     g. I was given an inadequate six-day appeal period without notice; and
     h. I could not afford legal representation and was not informed of my right to counsel.

112. The judgment is based on fraud because:
     a. It includes Ten Thousand One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($10,150.00) in arrears that had been dismissed by agreement with Ms. Neely's consent;
     b. It is based solely on Ms. Neely's unverified hearsay affidavit;
     c. Ms. Neely knowingly and intentionally included dismissed arrears in her affidavit, despite having personally consented to the dismissal;
     d. The State admits it has no records for 2008-2013;
     e. DCFS has sent five (5) contradictory audits, proving fabrication of arrears; and
     f. Ms. Neely's 2013 affidavit contradicts her 2006 affidavit and is mathematically impossible.

113. The judgment violates res judicata because it re-adjudicates arrears that were dismissed by agreement.

114. The judgment should be vacated and set aside pursuant to Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Article 2004.

FURTHER AFFIANT SAYETH NAUGHT.
