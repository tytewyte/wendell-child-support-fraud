PART 3: TEXAS SB-718 "TIME TAKEN TIME BACK" LAW
===================================================================

OFFICIAL NAME: Senate Bill 718 (88th Texas Legislature)
EFFECTIVE DATE: September 1, 2023
STATUS: PASSED AND ENACTED IN TEXAS

WHAT IT DOES:
Requires Texas courts to order additional periods of possession or 
access to a child to compensate for time lost during a Department 
of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) investigation that did 
NOT result in a finding of abuse or neglect.

KEY PROVISIONS:
• If DFPS investigates and finds NO abuse or neglect
• Parent who lost time with child during investigation
• Court MUST order additional time to compensate
• Unless party shows "good cause" why not
• Does not create cause of action against DFPS
• Does not waive sovereign immunity

WHY THIS MATTERS:
Before SB-718: Parents falsely accused lost time with their 
children during investigations, and even when cleared, they never 
got that time back.

After SB-718: Parents who are cleared MUST be given additional 
time to make up for what they lost.

THIS IS JUSTICE!

HOW THIS APPLIES TO YOU:
• You were falsely accused (Charlotte's lies)
• You lost time with your children
• You were cleared (no abuse or neglect)
• Under SB-718 (if in Texas), you'd get that time back
• Louisiana needs this law too!

===================================================================

   My name is Charles Wendell Avant Jr. from Louisiana. I am fighting 
   a child support fraud case with DCFS that exemplifies every abuse 
   your nine bills address: false allegations, financial abuse (over 
   $25,000 stolen), lack of transparency (five contradictory audits),

  and amounts
• DCFS admitted in writing they have NO RECORDS for 2008-2013
• My ex-wife filed TWO contradictory sworn affidavits (471% increase)
• A hearing officer called me a "deadbeat dad" and refused to 
  review my evidence

  my life

I've been through.

YOUR WORK INSPIRES ME:
You turned your personal adversity into advocacy. You drafted 
SB-718 and got it passed in Texas. You created nine bills that
