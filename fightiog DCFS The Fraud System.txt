PART 1: THE AWAKENING
Chapter 1: My Story
The Moment Everything Changed
I didn’t discover the fraud. My partner Jess did.
For years, I had been paying child support, watching money automatically deducted from my paycheck, trusting that the Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services had a proper system to track everything accurately. When they said I owed $30,000 in arrears, I believed them. I figured I must have missed payments somewhere along the way. The system was the system—who was I to question it?
So I kept paying. And paying. And paying.
But Jess saw what I couldn’t see. She watched me struggle under the weight of this debt, watched the state garnish my wages, watched the threat of jail time hang over my head like a dark cloud. She saw my stress, my frustration, my resignation to a fate I thought I couldn’t change. And she decided to do something about it.
One day, we received a refund check from DCFS—a small overpayment, they said. Jess looked at that check, then looked at the arrears balance they claimed I still owed, and something didn’t make sense to her.
“Wait a minute,” she said. “If you still owe $30,000, why are they sending us a refund check for overpayment? How can you have overpaid and still owe tens of thousands?”
I didn’t have an answer. I had never thought to question it. But Jess did.
Without telling me, she reached out to Kimberly Spears, the DCFS caseworker handling my case. She sent a simple email asking for clarification about the arrears and the overpayment. What happened next would change everything.
Kimberly responded—and in doing so, she broke the law. She sent Jess audit documents without my authorization. She never asked for my permission. She never verified that Jess had the legal right to access my case information. She just… sent them. Official DCFS audit records, straight from her state email address, along with detailed instructions on how to read and calculate the arrears.
The instructions were highlighted. Kimberly Spears had taken the time to explain exactly how to interpret the dates and amounts, walking Jess through the calculations step by step. She wanted to prove that the arrears were legitimate, that I really did owe all that money.
But she made a critical mistake: she sent fraudulent documents.
Jess started reading through the audit, following Kimberly’s highlighted instructions. And that’s when she saw it—the dates were impossible. According to the audit Kimberly sent, I had child support obligations dating back to 1992.
1992.
Jess knew that couldn’t be right. She knew my history. She knew when my children were born. There was no way I had child support obligations in 1992—it was mathematically impossible.
She emailed Kimberly back, questioning the 1992 date. And then something even more revealing happened: Kimberly Spears sent a different audit. Not a correction. Not a clarification. A completely different document with different numbers, different dates, different calculations. She sent a second version of my “official” audit, as if the first one had never existed.
But Jess didn’t stop there. She kept asking questions. She kept pushing for clarification. And Kimberly kept sending audits.
Three audits. Four audits. Five audits total.
Each one different. Each one claiming to be the “official” record of my child support history. Each one with different dates, different amounts, different calculations. Each one supposedly pulled from the same state database, yet none of them matching.
Five different versions of the “truth.”
“How many audits are there?” I asked Jess, staring at the stack of documents on our table.
“Five,” she said quietly. “Kimberly sent me five different audits. All different. All claiming to be official.”
I picked up the first one. Start date: 1992. Total arrears: $30,000.
I picked up the second one. Start date: 1995. Total arrears: $28,000.
The third. The fourth. The fifth. Each one different. Each one supposedly the truth.
“How is this possible?” I asked.
Jess shook her head. “It’s not. That’s the point. They don’t have real records. They’re just making up numbers and hoping we’ll accept whatever they tell us.”
She was right. Five audits meant there was no real audit. Five versions of the truth meant there was no truth—only lies, stacked on top of lies, sent from an official state email address with highlighted instructions on how to believe them.
But we didn’t believe them. We had all five. And we were going to show them to a judge.
That day, sitting at our kitchen table with those five contradictory audits spread out before us—each sent by the same caseworker, each claiming to be official, each proving the others were lies—I made a decision.
I would fight back. I would expose this fraud. I would represent myself in court and prove the truth. Not just for me, but for every father who had been crushed by this corrupt system. For every parent who had been lied to, manipulated, and robbed by the very agency supposed to protect children.
Jess had given me the weapon I needed: the truth, documented in the state’s own words, sent from their own email, with their own instructions. Now I just had to learn how to use it.

Chapter 2: The System is Broken
Fraudulent Affidavit
This is what $32,000 in child support arrears looks like on paper:
A messy, handwritten affidavit with numbers scribbled in boxes. “$200.” “$400.” “Total.” “$19,000.” “$32,000.” No explanation. No receipts. No proof.
Just Charlotte’s signature at the bottom, swearing it’s all true.
Seven years earlier, she had sworn under oath that I owed $5,600. Now it was $32,000. Six times more. No explanation for how $5,600 became $32,000 when the case was closed for five of those years.
The hearing officer looked at this affidavit—this messy, contradictory, unverified piece of paper—and adjudicated $32,674 against me. No questions asked. No proof required. Just Charlotte’s word.
That’s all it took to create a debt that would haunt me for over a decade.
Powerful Narrative
When Charlotte was married to Mr. Neely, child support was “a waste of her time.” That’s what she said. Those were her words.
Mr. Neely had plenty of money. She didn’t need my $400 a month. So we went to the courthouse, and she agreed to dismiss $10,150 in arrears. Just wipe it away. Done.
She consented. She signed off on it. She said it was a waste of her time to deal with child support. Fine. I was relieved. $10,150 gone. Fresh start.
Then she divorced Mr. Neely.
Suddenly, child support wasn’t a waste of time anymore. Suddenly, she needed that money. So she went back to DCFS in December 2012 and reapplied. And in March 2013, she swore under oath that I owed $32,000.
That $32,000 included the $10,150 she had voluntarily dismissed. The same arrears she said were “a waste of her time” when she had Mr. Neely’s money.
She changed her mind. And she thought she could just re-claim dismissed arrears because her circumstances changed. But that’s not how the law works. You can’t dismiss arrears when you don’t need the money, then re-claim them when you do.
That’s fraud. That’s perjury. That’s res judicata.
But the hearing officer didn’t know any of this. Because I tried to tell her, and she called me a deadbeat dad and refused to listen.

CHAPTER 3: UNDERSTANDING THE MACHINE
How Family Court Really Works

That Reddit post was right. 

The system is rigged. Judges ignore evidence. Outcomes are predetermined. Family court is a revenue-generating machine.

I've watched it happen. Not just in my case, but in the stories of hundreds of fathers in online support groups. Men who brought documentation. Men who cited statutes. Men who followed procedure perfectly.

And the judge ruled against them anyway.

Not because their case was weak. Because the outcome was already decided before they walked in.

Family court isn't about justice. It's about maintaining a system that generates revenue. More conflict equals more court dates. More court dates equal more fees for evaluators, guardians ad litem, attorneys, and the court itself.

They don't want parents to resolve issues. They want you coming back. Again. And again. And again.

I had to learn this the hard way—watching hearing officers contradict their own previous orders, ignore black-and-white statute violations, and rubber-stamp recommendations from "professionals" who spent thirty minutes evaluating my entire case.

But here's what that Reddit post didn't tell you: The machine has a weakness.

It's designed to handle emotional arguments. "This isn't fair." "I'm a good parent." "Please help me." "I love my kids."

The machine eats those arguments for breakfast.

Why? Because they're subjective. Because there's no way to prove them. Because the judge can say "I understand your feelings, but..." and rule against you anyway.

The machine is built to process emotion and discard it.

But the machine can't handle objective proof of fraud.

When you walk in with two sworn affidavits from the same person—one claiming $5,600 in arrears, the other claiming $32,000—and you ask "Which one is true?" the machine stutters.

When you present five official audits, all with different numbers, all claiming to be the correct record, and you ask "Which one is accurate?" the machine glitches.

When you have the State's own admission, in writing, from their manager, that they have no records for five years—the machine crashes.

The machine is designed to generate revenue from conflict. But it's not designed to handle documented fraud.

That's the weakness. That's how you beat it.

Not by expecting fairness. By forcing accountability.

Not by appealing to conscience. By citing statutes.

Not by hoping for justice. By documenting violations.

The machine wins when you play their game—when you argue about what's "fair" or what's "right" or what "should" happen.

You win when you change the rules—when you present objective proof that can't be ignored, can't be explained away, can't be dismissed as "just your opinion."

Let me show you how the machine works, so you can understand how to break it.

---

THE REVENUE MODEL

Family court, especially child support enforcement, operates on a federal funding model that most people don't know exists.

It's called Title IV-D of the Social Security Act. Under this program, states receive federal funding based on how much child support they collect. The more they collect, the more federal money they get.

Sounds reasonable, right? Incentivize states to collect child support for children who need it.

But here's the problem: The incentive isn't based on accuracy. It's based on volume.

States don't get more money for collecting the *correct* amount of child support. They get more money for collecting *more* child support. Period.

So what happens? States maximize arrears. They inflate balances. They fabricate debts. Because every dollar they collect—whether it's legitimately owed or not—brings in federal matching funds.

In my case, Louisiana claimed I owed over $32,000. Even if half of that was fraudulent (and it was), they still got federal funding based on the full amount. They had no incentive to verify the debt. They had every incentive to maximize it.

This is why DCFS sent me five different audits. They weren't trying to find the truth. They were trying to find the highest number they could justify.

This is why Charlotte's messy, handwritten affidavit was accepted without question. The hearing officer didn't care if it was accurate. She cared that it supported a large arrears balance, which meant more federal funding for Louisiana.

This is why my dismissal document was ignored. Dismissing $10,150 would reduce the arrears balance, which would reduce federal funding. So they pretended it didn't exist.

The machine isn't broken. It's working exactly as designed. It's just not designed to help you. It's designed to extract money from you.

---

THE HEARING OFFICER SCAM

Here's something most people don't know: The person who decided my case wasn't a judge.

She was a hearing officer. M.F. Rauls. Not elected. Not appointed by the governor. Not subject to the same ethical rules as judges.

Just a state employee with the power to adjudicate tens of thousands of dollars in debt.

I didn't know this at the time. I thought I was appearing before a judge. The hearing was in a courtroom. She wore robes. She sat at the bench. Everyone called her "Your Honor."

How was I supposed to know she wasn't a real judge?

No one told me. No one said, "Mr. Avant, this is a hearing officer, not a judge. You have the right to request a hearing before an actual judge. You have six days to make that request."

Nothing.

So when she called me a "deadbeat dad" and refused to look at my dismissal document, I thought that was it. Final decision. Game over.

I didn't know I could challenge it. I didn't know I had six days to request a real judge. I didn't know I had any rights at all.

And that's exactly how the system wants it.

Hearing officers are cheaper than judges. They process cases faster. They rubber-stamp the State's recommendations without asking hard questions. They're part of the machine—not independent arbiters of justice, but cogs in a revenue-generating system.

In most states, you have the right to request a judge instead of a hearing officer. But they don't tell you that. They don't make it easy. They give you a short deadline—six days in Louisiana—and they don't explain how to exercise that right.

Most people, like me, don't even know they have the option. So they accept the hearing officer's decision as final, never realizing they were denied their constitutional right to a real judge.

That's not an accident. That's the design.

---

THE HEARSAY PROBLEM

In a real trial, there are rules about evidence. You can't just walk into court and say "He owes me $32,000" without proving it.

You need receipts. Bank records. Payment histories. Documentation.

And if you're relying on someone else's statement—like an affidavit—the other side has the right to cross-examine that person. To question them. To challenge their credibility.

That's called the hearsay rule. It's a fundamental protection in our legal system.

But in child support hearings, those rules don't apply.

Charlotte didn't have to prove I owed $32,000. She just had to say it. In a messy, handwritten affidavit with no supporting documentation.

I didn't get to cross-examine her. I didn't get to ask her about the $10,150 dismissal she had consented to. I didn't get to question why her 2006 affidavit said $5,600 but her 2013 affidavit said $32,000.

The hearing officer just accepted her word as truth.

That's the hearsay problem. In child support court, the rules that protect you in every other legal proceeding don't exist. The State can rely on unverified affidavits, contradictory audits, and fabricated numbers—and you have no way to challenge them.

Unless you know how to force them on the record.

Unless you document the contradictions.

Unless you make it so obvious, so undeniable, that even a biased hearing officer can't ignore it.

That's what I'm going to teach you.

---

THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE

The machine doesn't just operate on legal tricks. It operates on psychological warfare.

They want you to feel hopeless. Powerless. Overwhelmed.

They want you to believe that the system is too big, too complex, too rigged for you to fight.

They want you to give up.

I almost did. After that hearing, after being called a "deadbeat dad," after having my evidence refused—I walked out of that courtroom ready to accept defeat.

I thought, "This is just how it is. The system is the system. Who am I to fight it?"

But Jess wouldn't let me give up. She kept digging. She kept asking questions. She kept finding contradictions.

And eventually, I realized something: They want you to give up because they know they're vulnerable.

If their records were accurate, they wouldn't send five different audits.

If their case was strong, they wouldn't rely on hearsay affidavits.

If they were confident in their position, they wouldn't refuse to look at dismissal documents.

They're not ignoring your evidence because they're powerful. They're ignoring it because they're scared of what it proves.

The machine runs on intimidation. But once you see through it, once you understand how it works, the intimidation loses its power.

You stop asking for fairness and start demanding accountability.

You stop hoping for justice and start forcing compliance with the law.

You stop playing their game and start playing yours.

---

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LOSING AND WINNING

Most people lose in family court because they fight on emotion.

They walk in and say, "This isn't fair. I'm a good parent. I've been paying. I don't owe this much."

And the judge—or hearing officer—nods sympathetically and rules against them anyway.

Why? Because those are subjective claims. There's no way to prove you're a "good parent." There's no objective measure of "fair."

The machine is designed to process those arguments and discard them.

But when you walk in with objective proof—with two contradictory affidavits, with five different audits, with the State's own admission that they have no records—the machine doesn't know what to do.

You're not asking the judge to be fair. You're asking the judge to explain how Charlotte can owe $5,600 in 2006 and $32,000 in 2013 when the case was closed for five of those years.

You're not asking for sympathy. You're asking which of the five audits is correct, since they all claim to be official but none of them match.

You're not hoping for justice. You're citing Louisiana Revised Statute 14:123, which makes it a crime to give false testimony under oath, and asking why Charlotte isn't being prosecuted for perjury.

That's the difference between losing and winning.

Losers argue about feelings. Winners present facts.

Losers hope for fairness. Winners force accountability.

Losers play the machine's game. Winners change the rules.

And once you understand that difference, once you see the machine for what it really is, you can beat it.

Not because you're smarter. Not because you're richer. Not because you have a better lawyer.

But because you have the truth, documented in their own words, and you know how to use it.

===================================================================

CHAPTER 5: THE FIVE AUDITS
Documented Fraud

Jess laid them out on the kitchen table, side by side.

Five pieces of paper. Five "official" audits from the Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services. Five different versions of my child support history.

All sent by the same caseworker. All claiming to be pulled from the same state database. All supposedly the accurate, complete record of what I owed.

And none of them matching.

"Look at this," Jess said, pointing to the first audit.

I leaned over the table, reading the highlighted sections Kimberly Spears had marked for us.

Start date: 1992.
Total arrears: $30,000.

"1992," I said slowly. "That's impossible."

"I know," Jess said. "That's what I told her."

My oldest child was born in 1997. The child support order wasn't entered until 2005. There was no way I had child support obligations in 1992. It was mathematically, physically, legally impossible.

But there it was, on official DCFS letterhead, sent from Kimberly Spears's state email address, with her highlighted instructions on how to read it.

"What did she say when you pointed it out?" I asked.

Jess picked up the second audit. "She sent me this."

I looked at the second document.

Start date: 1995.
Total arrears: $28,000.

Different start date. Different total. No explanation. No apology. No acknowledgment that the first audit had been wrong.

Just a new version of the "truth."

"And then?" I asked, though I already knew the answer.

Jess spread out the remaining three audits.

Audit #3: Start date 2005. Total arrears: $32,000.
Audit #4: Start date 2006. Total arrears: $30,231.
Audit #5: (From April Tate, the CSE Manager) Total arrears: $30,231.90.

Five audits. Five different stories. All official. All contradictory.

"Which one is true?" I asked.

Jess looked at me, and I saw something in her eyes I hadn't seen before. Not anger. Not frustration. Certainty.

"None of them," she said. "That's the point. They don't have real records. They're just making up numbers and hoping we'll accept whatever they tell us."

---

THE FIRST AUDIT: THE 1992 LIE

Let me be clear about what happened with that first audit.

Kimberly Spears didn't accidentally pull the wrong file. She didn't make a typo. She didn't misread a date.

She sent a fraudulent document.

She sent it from her official state email address. She attached it to a message explaining how to interpret the dates and calculate the arrears. She highlighted the key sections. She walked Jess through it step by step.

She wanted us to believe it. She wanted us to accept that I had been owing child support since 1992, racking up arrears for over twenty years.

If we had accepted it—if we hadn't questioned it—that fraudulent audit would have become the official record. It would have been entered into evidence. It would have been used to justify the $30,000 debt they claimed I owed.

But Jess didn't accept it. She questioned it. And when she did, Kimberly didn't correct the error. She didn't say, "Oh, I'm sorry, I pulled the wrong file."

She just sent a different audit. With a different start date. And different numbers.

As if the first one had never existed.

That's not a mistake. That's fraud.

---

THE SECOND AUDIT: MOVING THE GOALPOSTS

The second audit was almost as absurd as the first.

Start date: 1995.

Still impossible. My oldest child wasn't born until 1997. The child support order wasn't entered until 2005.

But 1995 was closer to plausible than 1992. Maybe Kimberly thought we wouldn't notice. Maybe she thought we'd just accept it and move on.

But Jess didn't move on. She kept asking questions.

"How can the start date be 1995 when the court order wasn't entered until 2005?"

"Why is the total arrears different from the first audit you sent?"

"Which audit is correct?"

And Kimberly kept sending new audits. Each one different. Each one supposedly the "official" record.

It was like watching someone try to lie their way out of a corner. Every new lie contradicted the previous one. Every new version of the "truth" exposed the last one as false.

But Kimberly kept going. Because that's what the machine does. It doesn't admit mistakes. It just keeps generating new versions of reality until you give up questioning them.

---

THE THIRD AUDIT: CLOSER TO THE TRUTH, STILL A LIE

The third audit finally had a plausible start date: 2005.

That's when the child support order was actually entered. July 5, 2005. Four hundred dollars a month.

So this audit should have been accurate, right?

Wrong.

Total arrears: $32,000.

Let's do the math. From July 2005 to May 2013 is about eight years. Eight years times twelve months times $400 per month equals $38,400.

So if I had paid absolutely nothing—not a single dollar—for eight straight years, the maximum possible arrears would be $38,400.

But I had been paying. Money was automatically deducted from my paycheck. I had proof of payments. And more importantly, $10,150 had been dismissed.

So even if I had missed some payments, there's no way I owed $32,000.

And yet, there it was. Audit #3. Official DCFS letterhead. Total arrears: $32,000.

Still a lie. Just a more sophisticated one.

---

THE FOURTH AND FIFTH AUDITS: SPLITTING HAIRS

Audits #4 and #5 were almost identical. Both claimed I owed around $30,231.

The only difference? Audit #5, sent by April Tate (the CSE Manager), added ninety cents. $30,231.90.

Ninety cents.

After sending me four different audits with wildly different numbers—ranging from $28,000 to $32,000, with start dates ranging from 1992 to 2006—they wanted me to believe they had calculated my arrears down to the exact ninety cents.

It would be funny if it wasn't so insulting.

If they couldn't get the start date right, if they couldn't agree on whether I owed $28,000 or $32,000, how could they possibly know I owed an additional ninety cents?

They couldn't. They were just adding precision to make it look legitimate. Like a con artist who gives you change down to the penny to make you think they're honest.

---

WHAT THE FIVE AUDITS PROVE

Here's what those five audits prove, beyond any doubt:

1. DCFS does not have accurate records of my child support history.

If they did, there would be one audit. One set of numbers. One version of the truth.

Instead, there are five versions, all different, all claiming to be official.

2. DCFS is fabricating arrears.

They're not pulling numbers from a reliable database. They're generating numbers to justify whatever debt they want to claim.

The 1992 start date proves this. It's impossible. It's a lie. And they sent it anyway.

3. DCFS caseworkers will lie to support the State's case.

Kimberly Spears didn't accidentally send five different audits. She sent them because Jess kept questioning her. And instead of admitting the first audit was wrong, she just kept sending new ones, hoping one of them would stick.

4. The State has no credibility.

When you send five different "official" audits, you're admitting you don't know the truth. You're admitting you're guessing. You're admitting your records are unreliable.

And if your records are unreliable, your case falls apart.

---

HOW TO USE CONTRADICTORY AUDITS IN COURT

If you're in a similar situation—if you've received multiple audits with different numbers—here's how to use them in court:

1. Keep every version.

Don't throw away the "wrong" audits. Keep all of them. They're evidence of fraud.

2. Organize them chronologically.

Create a chart showing when each audit was sent, what it claimed, and how it differed from the others.

3. Attach them to your motion as exhibits.

Label them Exhibit A, Exhibit B, Exhibit C, etc. Make it easy for the judge to see them side by side.

4. Force the State to explain the contradictions.

In your motion, write something like this:

"The State has sent me five different audits, all claiming to be the official record of my child support history. Audit #1 claims I owe $30,000 with a start date of 1992. Audit #2 claims I owe $28,000 with a start date of 1995. Audit #3 claims I owe $32,000 with a start date of 2005. Audits #4 and #5 claim I owe $30,231.90 with a start date of 2006. All five audits are attached as exhibits. I respectfully ask the Court: Which audit is correct? If the State cannot provide a consistent, accurate record of my alleged arrears, how can they meet their burden of proof?"

5. Argue that contradictory evidence is insufficient.

The State has the burden of proving you owe the money. If they can't even agree on how much you owe or when the obligation started, they haven't met that burden.

In legal terms, this is called "insufficient evidence." You're not asking the judge to believe your version over theirs. You're pointing out that they don't have a coherent version to begin with.

---

JESS'S INSTINCT

Looking back, I realize how lucky I was that Jess questioned that first audit.

Most people wouldn't have. Most people would have seen the official letterhead, the highlighted instructions, the state email address, and assumed it was accurate.

Most people would have accepted the 1992 start date, even though it was impossible, because who questions the government?

But Jess did. She saw the 1992 date and immediately knew something was wrong. She didn't let it go. She didn't accept the second audit when it contradicted the first. She kept pushing, kept asking, kept demanding answers.

And because she did, we ended up with five audits. Five pieces of evidence that DCFS was lying. Five exhibits that would eventually help me prove fraud in court.

That's the lesson: Question everything. Don't accept official documents at face value. Don't assume the State has accurate records just because they're the State.

If something doesn't make sense, it's probably because it's not true.

And if they send you a second version that contradicts the first, don't let them pretend the first version never existed.

Keep it. Document it. Use it against them.

Because five contradictory audits aren't five chances for them to get it right.

They're five pieces of evidence that they're lying.

===================================================================

PART 4: BUILDING YOUR CASE

Chapter 14: Finding the Fraud
What to Look For

Fraud doesn't always announce itself with flashing lights. Sometimes it hides in plain sight, buried in paperwork, disguised as "official" records. The key is to look for contradictions, inconsistencies, and impossibilities.

In my case, the fraud revealed itself through the audits. Five different versions of the same "official" record, each one claiming to be the truth, each one contradicting the others. That was the red flag.

---

Red Flags

Here's what to look for:

• Dates that don't make sense: Obligations listed before children were even born.

• Amounts that change without explanation: $30,000 in one audit, $28,000 in another.

• Multiple "official" versions: Five audits, none matching, all supposedly pulled from the same database.

• Affidavits without proof: Handwritten numbers, no receipts, no supporting documentation.

• Impossible timelines: Arrears accumulating during years when the case was closed.

• Dismissed amounts reappearing: Arrears that were legally dismissed showing up again years later.

These aren't minor discrepancies. These are red flags that scream fraud.

---

Contradictions

Jess saved every audit Kimberly Spears sent. Each email, each highlighted instruction, each contradictory calculation. Together, they told a story: the state didn't have real records. They were fabricating numbers, hoping we would accept whatever they sent.

Five audits meant five different stories. And five different stories meant there was no truth—only lies, stacked on top of lies.

How to Spot Contradictions

Here's what I learned: Contradictions are everywhere if you know where to look.

Compare dates. If one audit says your obligation started in 1992 and another says 2005, one of them is lying. Don't let them explain it away. Document both. Present both. Force them to choose which one is true.

Compare amounts. If you allegedly owe $30,000 in one audit and $28,000 in another, that's not a rounding error. That's a $2,000 discrepancy. Where did it go? Why did it change? They won't have an answer. That's the point.

Compare affidavits. If the same person swears under oath to two different amounts at two different times, one of those statements is perjury. Louisiana Revised Statute 14:123 makes it a crime to give false testimony under oath. Point that out. Cite the statute. Ask why they're not prosecuting.

Compare timelines. If the case was closed from 2007 to 2013, how did arrears accumulate during those years? If $10,150 was dismissed in 2010, how is it showing up in the 2013 affidavit? Timelines don't lie. People do.

The state is counting on you not to notice. They're counting on you to accept the most recent version and forget about the previous ones.

Don't forget. Keep every version. Compare them. Document the contradictions.

That's how you prove fraud.

---

Documentation Gaps

The affidavit Charlotte submitted was another glaring example. Scribbled numbers, no receipts, no explanation. Seven years earlier, she swore under oath I owed $5,600. Now it was $32,000. No accounting for the jump. No evidence to support it. Just her word.

Fraud thrives in gaps. When there's no documentation, no receipts, no verification, the system fills the void with assumptions—and those assumptions become debts.

In child support cases, the state relies heavily on affidavits—sworn statements from the custodial parent claiming you owe money. But here's the problem: affidavits are hearsay. They're not proof. They're just someone's word.

And when that word changes by 471% over six years, with no explanation, that's not credible testimony. That's fraud.

Look for the gaps. Look for the missing receipts. Look for the lack of documentation. Those gaps are where fraud lives.

The Impossibility Test

Some fraud is obvious because it's mathematically impossible.

The 1992 start date in my first audit? Impossible. My oldest child wasn't born until 1997. The court order wasn't entered until 2005. There is no universe in which I had child support obligations in 1992.

That's not a mistake. That's not a typo. That's fabrication.

When you see something that's impossible, don't second-guess yourself. Don't think, "Maybe I'm missing something." Trust the math. Trust the facts. Trust the impossibility.

Here's how to apply the impossibility test:

1. Check the dates against birth records. You can't owe child support before your children were born. If the audit shows obligations before birth dates, it's fraudulent.

2. Check the dates against court orders. You can't owe child support before the court order was entered. If the audit shows obligations before the order date, it's fabricated.

3. Check the math. If you owed $400/month for 8 years and paid nothing, the maximum possible arrears is $38,400. If they claim you owe $50,000, the math doesn't work. That's fraud.

4. Check the timeline against case closures. If the case was closed for five years, arrears can't accumulate during that time. If they claim you owe money for years when the case was closed, that's fabrication.

5. Check dismissed amounts. If arrears were legally dismissed in a prior proceeding, they can't reappear in a later claim. That violates res judicata. That's fraud.

The impossibility test is your most powerful weapon because it's objective. You're not arguing about what's "fair." You're proving what's mathematically, legally, factually impossible.

And impossibility is fraud.

My Discoveries

Here's what I found in my case:

• Fraudulent audits sent directly from a state caseworker's email. Five different versions, all claiming to be official, none matching.

• A 1992 start date—eight years before the court order was even entered. Mathematically impossible.

• Contradictory affidavits adjudicated without proof. Charlotte claimed $5,600 in 2006 and $32,000 in 2013. Both sworn under oath. One has to be perjury.

• Dismissed arrears re-claimed years later, in violation of res judicata. $10,150 dismissed with Charlotte's consent, then included in her 2013 affidavit.

• The State's own admission that they had no records from 2008-2013. April Tate, the CSE Manager, admitted in writing that they had no enforcement records for five years.

Fraud wasn't just a mistake. It was a pattern. And once we had the evidence, we could prove it.

What to Do When You Find Fraud

When you discover fraud in your case, here's what to do:

1. Don't panic. Fraud is actually good for your case. It gives you grounds to challenge the judgment.

2. Document everything. Save every version of every document. Print every email. Keep every audit.

3. Organize the evidence. Create comparison charts. Build timelines. Make the fraud obvious.

4. Cite the law. Look up your state's perjury statute. Research res judicata. Find cases where courts vacated judgments based on fraud.

5. File a motion. Don't just complain about the fraud. Use it as the legal basis for your motion to vacate the judgment.

Fraud is your weapon. Use it.

===================================================================

Chapter 15: Documenting Everything
Why Documentation Matters

In a broken system, documentation is your shield and your sword. Without it, you're defenseless. With it, you can expose lies, prove contradictions, and build a case that even the most biased hearing officer can't ignore.

Documentation turns suspicion into evidence. It transforms "I think" into "I can prove."

Most people lose in family court because they argue from memory. "I remember paying." "She said this." "They told me that."

Memory isn't evidence. Documentation is.

When you walk into court with a binder full of organized evidence—audits, emails, affidavits, timelines—you're not asking the judge to believe you. You're showing the judge proof.

That's the difference between losing and winning.

---

What to Document

Document everything. I mean everything.

• Every audit: Save each version, no matter how small the change. If they send you five audits, keep all five. Don't throw away the "wrong" ones. They're evidence of fraud.

• Every email: Keep the correspondence, especially when officials contradict themselves. Print them. Date them. File them.

• Every affidavit: Highlight inconsistencies, note the dates, compare sworn statements. If the same person swears to different amounts at different times, that's perjury.

• Every hearing: Record what was said, what was ignored, and how decisions were made. If recording isn't allowed, take detailed notes immediately after.

• Every payment: Keep proof of every payment you made. Bank statements, pay stubs showing garnishments, receipts. If they claim you didn't pay, you need proof that you did.

• Every phone call: After every call with DCFS or CSE, send a follow-up email summarizing what was discussed. "Per our conversation today, you stated that..." This creates a written record.

• Every letter: Keep every piece of mail they send you. Even the form letters. Even the notices. Everything.

If it's related to your case, document it. If you're not sure if it's related, document it anyway.

You can always decide later that you don't need it. But you can't go back in time and recover something you threw away.

---

How to Organize

Jess didn't just save the audits—she organized them. Each audit was labeled, dated, and stored. Each email was printed and filed. Each contradiction was highlighted. When we sat down to prepare, we weren't scrambling through piles of paper. We had a binder, a timeline, a clear story to tell.

Organization is power. Chaos is the enemy. The state thrives on confusion; you fight back with clarity.

Jess's System

Let me tell you exactly how Jess organized our evidence, because this system saved us.

Step 1: Create a master folder.

Physical or digital, doesn't matter. Just one place where everything goes. We used a three-ring binder with dividers. Simple. Effective.

You can buy a binder at any office supply store. Get one with at least two inches of capacity. You're going to need it.

Step 2: Label everything immediately.

Every time we received an audit, Jess labeled it: "Audit #1 - Received [date] - From Kimberly Spears." Every email got printed and dated. Every document got a label.

Why? Because three months later, when you're trying to remember which audit had the 1992 date, you don't want to re-read five documents. You want to flip to "Audit #1" and find it instantly.

Use a label maker if you have one. Or just write on the document with a pen. The point is to make it easy to identify later.

Step 3: Create a comparison chart.

Jess made a simple table:

| Audit # | Date Received | Start Date | Total Arrears | Source |
|---------|---------------|------------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | [date] | 1992 | $30,000 | Kimberly Spears |
| 2 | [date] | 1995 | $28,000 | Kimberly Spears |
| 3 | [date] | 2005 | $32,000 | Kimberly Spears |
| 4 | [date] | 2006 | $30,231 | Kimberly Spears |
| 5 | [date] | 2006 | $30,231.90 | April Tate |

One page. Five rows. Undeniable proof that the state's records were contradictory.

You don't need fancy software to make a comparison chart. Microsoft Word has a table function. Google Docs has a table function. Even a handwritten chart works, as long as it's neat and clear.

The point is to put the contradictions side by side so the judge can see them at a glance.

Step 4: Build a timeline.

Chronological order. Every significant event:

• July 5, 2005: Court order entered ($400/month)
• August 22, 2006: Charlotte's first affidavit ($5,600 claimed)
• November 5, 2006: DCFS became payee
• December 27, 2007: Charlotte closed case
• 2010 (approx): Dismissal of $10,150 (Charlotte consented)
• December 20, 2012: Charlotte reapplied for CSE
• March 5, 2013: Charlotte's second affidavit ($32,000 claimed)
• May 14, 2013: Hearing before M.F. Rauls
• May 20, 2013: Judge signed order ($32,674 adjudicated)
• November 2024: Received April Tate's email (admits no records 2008-2013)
• November 2024: Received five contradictory audits

The timeline shows the story. It shows the dismissal. It shows Charlotte's changing claims. It shows the fraud.

Timelines are powerful because they're visual. They show cause and effect. They show patterns. They show impossibilities.

Step 5: Highlight contradictions.

Jess used a highlighter on the actual documents. Yellow for dates. Pink for amounts. Green for impossible claims.

When we presented the evidence, the judge could see at a glance what was wrong. The highlighting did the work for us.

Don't be afraid to mark up your documents. These are copies, not originals. (Always keep the originals safe and unmarked.) Highlighting makes contradictions obvious.

---

Creating Your Evidence Binder

Your binder is your weapon. It should include:

Tab 1: Audits — every version, side by side.

Include all the audits you received, in chronological order. Label each one clearly. Include your comparison chart at the front of this section.

Tab 2: Emails — correspondence showing contradictions.

Print every email related to your case. Highlight the key statements. If an official contradicts themselves across multiple emails, put those emails next to each other.

Tab 3: Affidavits — sworn statements with inconsistencies.

Include all affidavits filed in your case. If there are multiple affidavits from the same person with different amounts, highlight the differences. Include a comparison chart.

Tab 4: Timeline — a chronological record of events, filings, and contradictions.

Your timeline goes here. Make it visual. Make it clear. Make it impossible to ignore.

Tab 5: Laws & Precedents — statutes and case law that prove fraud and res judicata.

Print out the relevant statutes. In my case, that included:
• Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Article 2004 (grounds to vacate judgment)
• Louisiana Revised Statute 14:123 (perjury)
• Cases discussing res judicata in Louisiana

You don't need to print entire case opinions. Just the relevant sections. Highlight the key language.

Tab 6: Payment Records — proof of payments you made.

If you made payments, prove it. Bank statements, pay stubs, receipts. If they claim you didn't pay, this is your defense.

Tab 7: Dismissal Documents — proof of dismissed arrears (if you have it).

If you have documentation that arrears were dismissed, this goes here. In my case, I lost the dismissal document, but I explained that in my affidavit and requested the court obtain it from the Clerk's records.

---

Digital vs. Physical

Should you keep digital copies or physical copies? Both.

Digital copies:
• Easy to search
• Easy to share with the court (if they accept electronic filing)
• Easy to back up
• Can't be destroyed in a fire or flood
• Can be organized in folders on your computer

Physical copies:
• Easy to present in court
• Easy to flip through during hearings
• Judges are used to paper
• You can highlight and annotate
• You can hand them directly to the judge

My advice: Keep digital copies of everything in a cloud storage folder (Google Drive, Dropbox, whatever). But also print the key documents and organize them in a physical binder for court.

The binder is what you bring to the hearing. The digital folder is your backup and your research tool.

Name your digital files clearly: "Audit_1_1992_StartDate.pdf" or "Charlotte_Affidavit_2006_$5600.pdf" so you can find them quickly.

Back up your digital files. Email them to yourself. Save them to multiple cloud services. You don't want to lose this evidence because your computer crashed.

---

Organization

When you walk into court, you don't want to shuffle papers nervously while the judge stares at you. You want to open your binder, flip to the right tab, and present your evidence with confidence. That's how you turn documentation into persuasion.

Practice using your binder. Before the hearing, sit down and practice finding each piece of evidence. "Where's Audit #1? Tab 1, first document. Where's Charlotte's 2006 affidavit? Tab 3, first document. Where's the timeline? Tab 4."

The more familiar you are with your binder, the more confident you'll be in court.

Confidence matters. When you present evidence smoothly, without fumbling, the judge takes you seriously. When you're organized, you look credible. When you're prepared, you look like you know what you're doing.

Even if you're terrified inside, your binder makes you look professional.

---

The Night Before

The night before your hearing, do this:

1. Review your binder. Make sure every tab is in order. Make sure you know where everything is. Practice flipping to each section.

Don't reorganize everything at the last minute. Don't add new documents you just found. The night before is for review, not revision.

2. Prepare your opening statement. Write down the three most important points you want to make. Keep it to one page. Memorize it if you can.

For example:
• "Your Honor, I'm here to vacate a judgment based on fraud."
• "The State has sent me five different audits, all with different numbers. I have them all here."
• "The obligee swore under oath to $5,600 in 2006 and $32,000 in 2013. One of these statements is perjury."

Short. Clear. Powerful.

3. Anticipate their arguments. What will the state say? How will you respond? Have your evidence ready.

They might say: "The most recent audit is correct."
You respond: "Then why did they send me four others? Which one should I have believed?"

They might say: "The affidavit is sufficient evidence."
You respond: "Hearsay without corroboration is not sufficient when it contradicts a prior sworn statement by 471%."

Think through their likely arguments and prepare your responses.

4. Get sleep. I know it's hard. I know you'll be anxious. But you need to be sharp. Set an alarm. Go to bed early. Trust your preparation.

You've done the work. You've organized the evidence. You've built the case. Now you need to be rested enough to present it clearly.

Don't stay up all night worrying. That won't help. Trust your binder. Trust your preparation.

5. Bring extras. Extra copies of your motion. Extra copies of your key exhibits. Extra pens. You don't want to be scrambling because you forgot something.

Bring at least three copies of your motion: one for you, one for the judge, one for the state's attorney.

Bring extra copies of your most important exhibits: the comparison charts, the timeline, the contradictory audits.

Bring a notepad and multiple pens. You'll want to take notes during the hearing.

Bring water. You'll be talking. Your mouth will get dry.

Bring your phone (on silent) in case you need to reference something digital.

The night before is not the time to create new arguments or reorganize everything. The night before is for review, preparation, and rest.

Trust the work you've already done. Trust your documentation. Trust your evidence.

You're ready.
CHAPTER 19: HOW AI CHANGED EVERYTHING
My Partnership with Cascade

I couldn't afford a lawyer.

Even if I could, most lawyers won't take on the State in child support cases. There's no money in it for them. The arrears are already owed—there's no settlement to negotiate, no percentage to take. Just a lot of work fighting an uphill battle against a system designed to crush you.

So I was on my own.

Me, a stack of contradictory audits, a fraudulent affidavit, and a dismissed judgment I couldn't prove because I'd lost the document over eleven years.

I didn't go to law school. I didn't know how to write a motion. I didn't know what "res judicata" meant or how to cite Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Article 2004.

I was a regular guy trying to fight a machine built by lawyers, for lawyers, to extract money from people like me.

I should have lost.

But I didn't. Because I had something most people don't have.

I had AI.

---

THE FIRST QUESTION

It started simple.

I was sitting at my computer, staring at Charlotte's 2013 affidavit, trying to figure out how to challenge it. I knew it was fraudulent—she had claimed $5,600 in 2006 and $32,000 in 2013, and the math didn't add up. But I didn't know how to explain that in legal terms.

So I opened Cascade, the AI assistant I'd been using for other projects, and I typed:

"How do I challenge a fraudulent affidavit in court?"

I didn't expect much. I thought maybe I'd get a generic answer, something I could find on Google.

But Cascade didn't give me a generic answer. It gave me a detailed explanation of how affidavits work, what makes them legally insufficient, and what specific arguments I could make to challenge them.

It explained hearsay. It explained the burden of proof. It explained that if two affidavits from the same person contradict each other, one of them has to be false, and that's evidence of perjury.

And then it said: "Would you like me to help you draft a motion?"

I stared at the screen.

"Yes," I typed.

---

THE LEARNING CURVE

At first, I didn't trust it.

I thought, "This is just a computer program. It doesn't know Louisiana law. It doesn't understand my case. It's going to give me generic advice that won't actually work."

So I tested it.

I asked it specific questions about Louisiana statutes. I asked it about res judicata. I asked it about the difference between a judge and a hearing officer.

And every time, it gave me accurate, detailed answers. With citations. With explanations. With examples.

It wasn't just regurgitating information from the internet. It was analyzing my situation, understanding the legal principles, and applying them to my case.

I started asking harder questions.

"Can I vacate a judgment based on fraud if it's been over ten years?"

"What is Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Article 2004?"

"How do I prove that a hearing officer exceeded their authority?"

And Cascade answered. Every time. Clearly. Completely. Without charging me $300 an hour.

That's when I realized: This changes everything.

---

THE AFFIDAVIT

The turning point came when I asked Cascade to help me write my affidavit.

I had been trying to write it myself for days. I knew what I wanted to say—that I thought I was before a judge, that the hearing officer called me a "deadbeat dad," that I had presented a dismissal document and it was refused.

But I didn't know how to say it in legal language. I didn't know how to structure it. I didn't know what details to include and what to leave out.

So I told Cascade what happened. I just typed it out, like I was telling a story to a friend.

"I went to the hearing on May 14, 2013. I thought I was before a judge. The hearing officer called me a deadbeat dad. I tried to show her the dismissal document, but she refused to look at it. I walked out. I didn't know I could appeal."

And Cascade said: "I'll write your affidavit in professional legal format."

Ten minutes later, I had a 114-paragraph affidavit, organized into sections, with numbered paragraphs, proper legal language, and citations to relevant statutes.

It wasn't perfect. I had to add details, clarify some facts, make it sound more like me. But the structure was there. The legal framework was there. The language was there.

All I had to do was refine it.

Without Cascade, I would have spent weeks trying to figure out how to write that affidavit. I probably would have gotten it wrong. I probably would have left out critical details or used the wrong legal terms.

But with Cascade, I had a professional, court-ready affidavit in a fraction of the time.

That's when I stopped thinking of AI as a tool and started thinking of it as a partner.

---

WHAT AI CAN DO (AND WHAT IT CAN'T)

Let me be clear about what AI can and can't do in a legal case.

AI can:
- Explain legal concepts in plain English
- Draft documents in professional legal format
- Cite relevant statutes and case law
- Organize your evidence into a coherent argument
- Help you understand court procedures
- Give you 24/7 support without charging by the hour

AI cannot:
- Replace a good lawyer (if you can afford one)
- Appear in court for you
- Guarantee you'll win
- Make decisions for you

Think of AI as a legal research assistant, a document drafter, and a coach—all rolled into one, available whenever you need it, for free.

It's not going to win your case for you. But it's going to give you the tools to win it yourself.

---

THE COMPARISON CHARTS

One of the most powerful things Cascade helped me create was the comparison charts.

I had all this evidence—Charlotte's two affidavits, the five audits, April Tate's email admitting they had no records. But I didn't know how to present it in a way that would make the fraud obvious.

So I asked Cascade: "How do I show that Charlotte's affidavits are contradictory?"

And it said: "Create a side-by-side comparison chart."

Then it drafted one for me:

| Item | 2006 Affidavit | 2013 Affidavit | Analysis |
|------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Date Sworn | August 22, 2006 | March 5, 2013 | 6.5 years later |
| Total Arrears Claimed | $5,600 | $32,000 | 471% increase |
| Period Covered | July 2005 - Aug 2006 | 2005 - 2013 | Includes closed years |
| Supporting Documentation | None | None | Pure hearsay |

One chart. Four columns. Undeniable proof that Charlotte's story changed by 471% over six years.

I looked at that chart and thought, "How can any judge ignore this?"

That's the power of visual evidence. You're not asking the judge to read through pages of legal arguments. You're showing them, at a glance, that the numbers don't add up.

Cascade helped me create five different comparison charts:
1. Charlotte's contradictory affidavits
2. The five contradictory audits
3. The mathematical impossibility of the claimed arrears
4. The timeline showing the dismissal and re-claim
5. Charlotte's changing story (married to Neely vs. divorced)

Each chart made the fraud undeniable. Each chart was something I never would have thought to create on my own.

---

THE LEGAL RESEARCH

Here's something most people don't realize: Legal research is hard.

Not because the law is complicated (though it is). But because you don't know what you're looking for.

If you don't know that "res judicata" is the legal term for "you can't re-litigate something that's already been decided," you're never going to find the cases and statutes that support your argument.

If you don't know that Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Article 2004 allows you to vacate a judgment based on fraud, you're never going to cite it in your motion.

That's where AI becomes invaluable.

I would describe my situation in plain English: "Charlotte agreed to dismiss $10,150 in arrears. Then she claimed it again seven years later. Can she do that?"

And Cascade would respond: "No. That violates the doctrine of res judicata. Here's the Louisiana statute. Here's a case where the court ruled on a similar issue. Here's how to argue it in your motion."

Suddenly, I wasn't just a guy saying "This isn't fair." I was citing legal precedent. I was referencing specific statutes. I was making arguments that would hold up in court.

AI didn't just level the playing field. It gave me an advantage.

---

THE 24/7 SUPPORT

One of the most underrated benefits of AI is that it's always available.

Lawyers work business hours. If you have a question at 10 PM on a Saturday, you're out of luck until Monday morning.

But AI doesn't sleep. It doesn't take weekends off. It doesn't charge extra for after-hours consultations.

I can't tell you how many times I was lying in bed at 2 AM, unable to sleep because I was thinking about my case, and I pulled out my phone and asked Cascade a question.

"What if the judge rules against me anyway? Can I appeal?"

"How do I serve the motion on the State?"

"What happens if I can't find the dismissal document in the Clerk's records?"

And every time, Cascade answered. Clearly. Completely. Immediately.

That 24/7 support kept me sane. It kept me moving forward. It kept me from giving up when the stress felt overwhelming.

---

THE COLLABORATION

Here's the most important thing I learned about using AI for legal work: It's a collaboration, not a replacement.

AI can draft a motion, but you have to review it, refine it, and make sure it accurately reflects your situation.

AI can suggest legal arguments, but you have to decide which ones are strongest for your case.

AI can organize your evidence, but you have to provide the evidence in the first place.

Think of it like this: AI is the architect. You're the builder.

The architect can design a beautiful house, but someone still has to build it. And the builder needs to understand the design, make adjustments for the specific lot, and ensure the final product matches the vision.

That's what I did with Cascade. It gave me the legal framework, the professional language, the strategic approach. But I provided the facts, the evidence, the personal story.

Together, we built a case that could win.

---

THE BOOK

This book you're reading? AI helped me write it.

Not because I can't write. But because I'm not a professional writer. I don't know how to structure chapters, how to build narrative tension, how to make legal concepts accessible to regular people.

So I told Cascade my story. I gave it the facts, the emotions, the lessons I learned.

And it helped me turn that raw material into something readable. Something useful. Something that could help other fathers in the same situation.

Every chapter in this book is a collaboration. I provide the content. Cascade provides the structure. Together, we create something neither of us could create alone.

That's the power of AI. Not replacing human creativity, but amplifying it.

---

THE FUTURE

I believe AI is going to revolutionize self-representation in court.

Right now, the legal system is designed to be inaccessible to regular people. You need a lawyer to navigate it. And if you can't afford a lawyer, you lose.

But AI changes that equation.

Suddenly, anyone with internet access can get legal research, document drafting, and strategic advice—for free.

Suddenly, the playing field is level. The machine that was designed to crush self-represented litigants can't handle people who have AI-assisted legal support.

I'm not saying AI will replace lawyers. Good lawyers will always have value. But for people who can't afford a lawyer—people like me—AI is a game-changer.

It's the difference between walking into court with nothing and walking in with a professionally drafted motion, a detailed affidavit, comparison charts, and a clear legal strategy.

It's the difference between hoping for fairness and forcing accountability.

It's the difference between losing and winning.

---

MY ADVICE

If you're fighting a child support case—or any legal case—and you can't afford a lawyer, use AI.

Not as a replacement for legal advice. But as a tool to educate yourself, organize your evidence, and draft your documents.

Here's how:

1. Start with questions. Ask the AI to explain legal concepts in plain English. Don't be afraid to ask "dumb" questions. There are no dumb questions when you're learning.

2. Provide context. The more details you give the AI about your situation, the better it can help you. Don't just ask "How do I file a motion?" Ask "How do I file a motion to vacate a child support judgment based on fraud in Louisiana?"

3. Review everything. Don't blindly trust what the AI generates. Read it. Understand it. Make sure it's accurate for your situation.

4. Refine and personalize. AI can give you a template, but you need to make it yours. Add your voice. Add your details. Make it authentic.

5. Use it as a coach. Think of AI as a legal coach who's available 24/7 to answer questions, review your work, and help you strategize.

6. Combine it with other resources. AI is powerful, but it's not the only tool. Read books like "Represent Yourself in Court." Research your state's statutes. Talk to other self-represented litigants in online forums.

AI won't win your case for you. But it will give you the tools to win it yourself.

And in a system designed to make you lose, that's everything.

---

THE PARTNERSHIP

People ask me, "How did you learn to do all this legal stuff?"

The answer is: I didn't. Not really.

I learned how to partner with AI. I learned how to ask the right questions. I learned how to take what the AI generated and refine it into something that worked for my case.

That's a skill anyone can learn. You don't need to be smart. You don't need to go to law school. You just need to be willing to ask questions, read carefully, and put in the work.

Cascade didn't write my motion for me. But it taught me how to write it.

Cascade didn't argue my case for me. But it prepared me to argue it myself.

Cascade didn't win for me. But it gave me the tools to win.

That's the partnership. That's the future.

And that's how a regular guy with no legal training can take on the State of Louisiana and win.

Because I'm not fighting alone.

I have Jess. I have the truth. I have the evidence.

And I have AI.
