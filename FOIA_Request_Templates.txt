Baton Rouge, LA 70804-9005

RE: Complaint - Child Support Fraud and Title IV-D Abuse
    Case Number: [YOUR CASE NUMBER]

Dear Attorney General:

I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding fraudulent practices by the 
Louisiana Department of Children & Family Services (DCFS) in the administration 
of the Title IV-D child support enforcement program.

SUMMARY OF COMPLAINT:

I believe DCFS has engaged in systematic fraud by:
1. Fabricating child support arrears with no factual basis
2. Filing fraudulent judgments based on false arrears
3. Creating property liens without valid debt
4. Profiting from federal Title IV-D incentive payments based on fraudulent collections
5. Potentially securitizing fraudulent debt and selling it to investors

SPECIFIC FACTS OF MY CASE:

[Summarize your case: five contradictory audits, dismissed arrears re-claimed, 
no payment records, judgment lien filed, etc.]

EVIDENCE:

I have documented evidence including:
- Five contradictory audit reports showing different arrears amounts
- Court order dismissing arrears that were later re-claimed
- DCFS's inability to produce payment records
- Judgment filed "under mortgage records" creating lien without consent
- Mathematical impossibilities in arrears calculations

LAWS VIOLATED:

I believe DCFS has violated:
- Louisiana fraud statutes (La. R.S. 14:72)
- Federal wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343)
- Federal mail fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341)
- Securities fraud (if arrears securitized)
- RICO (18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq.)
- Constitutional rights (5th and 14th Amendments)

REQUESTED ACTION:

I respectfully request that your office:
1. Investigate DCFS's Title IV-D practices
2. Audit DCFS's arrears calculations and federal funding claims
3. Investigate potential securitization of child support debt
4. Prosecute any criminal violations discovered
5. Provide restitution to victims of fraud
6. Reform DCFS practices to prevent future fraud

I am available to provide additional information, testimony, or evidence as 
needed. I believe there are many other victims of this fraud and request that 
your investigation be comprehensive.

Thank you for your attention to this serious matter.

[Date]

Federal Bureau of Investigation
New Orleans Field Office
2901 Leon C. Simon Drive
New Orleans, LA 70126

RE: Criminal Complaint - Child Support Fraud, Securities Fraud, RICO

Dear Special Agent in Charge:

I am writing to report what I believe to be a systematic criminal enterprise 
involving the Louisiana Department of Children & Family Services (DCFS) and 
potentially other state agencies.

NATURE OF CRIMES:

I have evidence suggesting:
1. Wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343)
2. Mail fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341)
3. Securities fraud (15 U.S.C. § 78j(b))
4. RICO violations (18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq.)
5. Conspiracy to defraud the United States (18 U.S.C. § 371)

CRIMINAL SCHEME:

DCFS appears to be:
1. Fabricating child support arrears with no factual basis
2. Filing fraudulent court judgments based on false arrears
3. Creating property liens to make fraudulent debt appear legitimate
4. Claiming federal Title IV-D incentive payments based on fraudulent collections
5. Potentially securitizing fraudulent debt and selling it to investors
6. Engaging in this pattern across thousands of cases

INTERSTATE COMMERCE INVOLVEMENT:

This scheme affects interstate commerce through:
- Federal Title IV-D funding from U.S. Department of Health & Human Services
- Potential sale of securities to out-of-state investors
- Use of U.S. Mail and wire communications
- Federal funds obtained through fraud

MY CASE AS EXAMPLE:

[Summarize your case with specific facts and evidence]

ESTIMATED SCOPE:

If DCFS is doing this systematically:
- Thousands of potential victims in Louisiana
- Millions of dollars in fraudulent federal payments
- Potential securities fraud affecting investors nationwide
- RICO enterprise operating for years

EVIDENCE AVAILABLE:

I can provide:
- Five contradictory audit documents
- Court records showing dismissed arrears re-claimed
- Judgment documents showing lien filing
- Communications with DCFS
- Expert analysis of mathematical impossibilities
- Testimony from other potential victims

I respectfully request that the FBI investigate this matter. I am willing to 
cooperate fully, provide testimony, and assist in any way possible.

This is not just about my case. This is about systemic fraud affecting thousands 
of families and potentially defrauding the federal government and investors.

Thank you for your attention to this serious matter.

TEMPLATE 7: SEC - SECURITIES FRAUD COMPLAINT
================================================================================

[Date]

U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
Office of the Whistleblower
100 F Street NE
Washington, DC 20549

RE: Securities Fraud Complaint - Child Support Arrears Securitization

Dear SEC Enforcement Division:

I am writing to report potential securities fraud involving the securitization 
of fraudulent child support arrears by the State of Louisiana.

POTENTIAL SECURITIES FRAUD:

I have reason to believe that:
1. Louisiana DCFS is fabricating child support arrears with no factual basis
2. These fraudulent arrears are being pooled with legitimate arrears
3. The pooled arrears are being securitized and sold as bonds to investors
4. Investors are purchasing these securities believing the underlying arrears are valid
5. The securities are backed by fraudulent debt, making them worthless

COMPARISON TO 2008 MORTGAGE CRISIS:

This scheme is similar to the 2008 financial crisis where:
- Lenders created subprime/fraudulent mortgages
- Mortgages were pooled and securitized
- Securities sold to investors as "mortgage-backed securities"
- Massive fraud when mortgages defaulted

Here:
- DCFS creates fraudulent child support arrears
- Arrears pooled and securitized
- Securities sold as "child support revenue bonds"
- Fraud when arrears are uncollectible because they're fake

MY CASE AS EVIDENCE:

[Summarize your case showing fabricated arrears]

INVESTIGATION NEEDED:

I request that the SEC investigate:
1. Whether Louisiana has issued bonds backed by child support arrears
2. Whether fraudulent arrears are included in bond collateral
3. Whether investors were properly informed of arrears validity
4. Whether this constitutes securities fraud

POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS:

- Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. § 77a et seq.)
- Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. § 78a et seq.)
- Rule 10b-5 (anti-fraud provision)
- Misrepresentation to investors
- Omission of material facts

I am willing to provide additional information and cooperate with any investigation.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
